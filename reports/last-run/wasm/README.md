## Historical Tracking

Reports include trend analysis:
- **Performance Trends**: Track improvements over time
- **Regression Detection**: Identify performance degradations
- **Quality Evolution**: Monitor test coverage and success rates
- **Capacity Planning**: Predict resource needs based on growth

## Usage Examples

### CI/CD Integration
```bash
# Run test suite and generate reports
cargo test --manifest-path wasm/riptide-extractor-wasm/Cargo.toml

# Check results for deployment decision
if [ "$(jq -r '.overall_success' reports/last-run/wasm/results.json)" = "true" ]; then
  echo "‚úÖ Tests passed - proceeding with deployment"
else
  echo "‚ùå Tests failed - blocking deployment"
  exit 1
fi
```

### Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Extract key metrics for monitoring
EXTRACTION_TIME=$(jq -r '.performance_summary.average_extraction_time_ms' reports/last-run/wasm/results.json)
MEMORY_USAGE=$(jq -r '.performance_summary.peak_memory_usage_mb' reports/last-run/wasm/results.json)

# Send metrics to monitoring system
curl -X POST "http://metrics.internal/api/v1/metrics" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"extraction_time_ms\": $EXTRACTION_TIME, \"memory_usage_mb\": $MEMORY_USAGE}"
```

### Quality Dashboard
```javascript
// Load test results into dashboard
fetch('/reports/last-run/wasm/results.json')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    updateDashboard({
      overallStatus: data.overall_success,
      extractionTime: data.performance_summary.average_extraction_time_ms,
      coverage: data.coverage_report.coverage_percentage,
      memoryUsage: data.performance_summary.peak_memory_usage_mb
    });
  });
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Test Failures
1. Check specific test category results in JSON report
2. Review error details in HTML report recommendations
3. Validate test environment and dependencies
4. Check for recent code changes that might affect tests

#### Performance Regressions
1. Compare current metrics with historical baselines
2. Profile memory usage and CPU utilization
3. Check for changes in extraction algorithms
4. Validate test data hasn't changed unexpectedly

#### Coverage Drops
1. Identify uncovered code in detailed coverage report
2. Add missing test cases for new functionality
3. Review effectiveness of existing tests
4. Consider integration test gaps

## Report Generation

Reports are automatically generated by the test suite:

```rust
// Test suite generates reports automatically
let results = run_comprehensive_test_suite()?;
generate_test_reports(&results)?;
```

Reports are refreshed on every test run, providing the latest insights into component quality and performance.

## Next Steps

Based on current results:

1. **Performance Optimization**: Continue optimizing extraction algorithms
2. **Test Coverage**: Add tests for edge cases and error conditions
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Further optimize memory usage patterns
4. **Production Monitoring**: Implement real-time performance tracking
5. **Automated Alerts**: Set up proactive alerting for regressions
