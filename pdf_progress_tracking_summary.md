# PDF Progress Tracking Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive PDF progress tracking in production with real-time streaming capabilities, metrics collection, and performance monitoring.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Enhanced PDF Pipeline Integration (`/workspaces/eventmesh/crates/riptide-core/src/pdf/integration.rs`)
- ✅ Added optional progress callback parameter to `process_pdf_bytes()`
- ✅ Created `process_pdf_to_extracted_doc_with_progress()` method
- ✅ Added `process_pdf_bytes_with_progress()` for streaming updates
- ✅ Integrated with existing processor's `process_pdf_with_progress()` method
- ✅ Added async progress channel creation

### 2. Progress Types Enhancement (`/workspaces/eventmesh/crates/riptide-core/src/pdf/types.rs`)
- ✅ Removed `#[allow(dead_code)]` from `ProcessingProgress` and `ProcessingStage`
- ✅ Added `ProgressUpdate` enum with serialization for different progress events:
  - `Started` - Processing initialization with document info
  - `Progress` - Page-by-page processing updates
  - `StageChanged` - Processing stage transitions
  - `Completed` - Successful completion with results
  - `Failed` - Processing failure with error details
  - `KeepAlive` - Connection maintenance
- ✅ Added `DetailedProgressCallback` type for enhanced progress tracking
- ✅ Added `ProgressSender`/`ProgressReceiver` types for async communication
- ✅ Added `create_progress_channel()` utility function

### 3. Streaming PDF Processing Endpoint (`/workspaces/eventmesh/crates/riptide-api/src/handlers/pdf.rs`)
- ✅ Created `/pdf/process` synchronous endpoint
- ✅ Created `/pdf/process-stream` NDJSON streaming endpoint
- ✅ Supports both JSON and multipart/form-data requests
- ✅ Real-time progress updates with enhanced metrics
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and validation
- ✅ File size limits (50MB) with proper error responses

### 4. Enhanced Metrics Collection (`/workspaces/eventmesh/crates/riptide-core/src/pdf/metrics.rs`)
- ✅ Added pages per second processing rate tracking
- ✅ Added average processing time per page monitoring
- ✅ Added progress callback overhead measurement
- ✅ Added performance metrics for Prometheus export:
  - `pdf_average_pages_per_second`
  - `pdf_average_progress_overhead_us`
  - `pdf_average_page_processing_time_ms`
- ✅ Thread-safe atomic metrics storage
- ✅ Memory efficiency calculations

### 5. Production-Ready Features
- ✅ Memory spike detection and cleanup (200MB hard limit)
- ✅ Concurrent processing limits (max 2 simultaneous operations)
- ✅ Progress streaming with backpressure handling
- ✅ Comprehensive error recovery
- ✅ Performance monitoring and bottleneck detection
- ✅ Resource management with automatic cleanup

### 6. Integration and Testing
- ✅ Integration tests for progress tracking functionality
- ✅ Serialization/deserialization tests for streaming
- ✅ Error handling and edge case tests
- ✅ Metrics collection validation tests
- ✅ Compilation verification
- ✅ Existing test compatibility maintained

## 📊 Performance Enhancements

### Real-Time Metrics
- **Pages per second** processing rate tracking
- **Memory usage** monitoring with spike detection
- **Progress callback overhead** measurement (microseconds)
- **Average processing time** per page calculation

### Streaming Optimizations
- **NDJSON** format for efficient streaming
- **Backpressure handling** for client connection management
- **Keep-alive messages** for connection stability
- **Enhanced progress updates** with performance data

### Resource Management
- **Memory limit enforcement** (200MB RSS spike protection)
- **Concurrent operation limits** (max 2 simultaneous)
- **Automatic cleanup** with aggressive memory management
- **Resource guards** ensuring cleanup on all exit paths

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### Synchronous Processing
```http
POST /pdf/process
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "pdf_data": "base64-encoded-pdf",
  "filename": "document.pdf",
  "url": "https://example.com/doc.pdf"
}
```

### Streaming Progress
```http
POST /pdf/process-stream
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "pdf_data": "base64-encoded-pdf",
  "stream_progress": true
}
```

Response: NDJSON stream with progress updates:
```json
{"type":"started","total_pages":10,"file_size":1024000,"timestamp":"..."}
{"type":"progress","current_page":5,"total_pages":10,"percentage":50.0,"stage":"ExtractingText"}
{"type":"completed","result":{...},"timestamp":"..."}
```

### Multipart Support
```http
POST /pdf/process
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

file: [PDF binary data]
filename: document.pdf
url: https://example.com/doc.pdf
```

## 🛡️ Production Safety

### Memory Management
- Hard 200MB RSS spike limit per worker
- Progressive memory pressure detection
- Automatic cleanup at configurable intervals
- Resource guards preventing memory leaks

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation on processing failures
- Detailed error reporting via progress stream
- Timeout protection (30 seconds default)
- Invalid PDF detection and early rejection

### Performance Monitoring
- Real-time metrics collection
- Prometheus-compatible metric export
- Bottleneck detection and alerting
- Processing rate optimization

## 🔍 Usage Examples

### Basic PDF Processing
```rust
let integration = create_pdf_integration_for_pipeline();
let result = integration
    .process_pdf_to_extracted_doc(&pdf_bytes, Some("https://example.com/doc.pdf"))
    .await?;
```

### Progress Tracking
```rust
let (sender, mut receiver) = integration.create_progress_channel();

tokio::spawn(async move {
    integration
        .process_pdf_bytes_with_progress(&pdf_bytes, sender)
        .await
});

while let Some(update) = receiver.recv().await {
    match update {
        ProgressUpdate::Progress(p) => {
            println!("Progress: {}%", p.percentage);
        }
        ProgressUpdate::Completed { result, .. } => {
            println!("Completed successfully");
            // Note: result is now Box<PdfProcessingResult>, use *result to access the value
            break;
        }
        _ => {}
    }
}
```

### Detailed Callback
```rust
let callback = Some(Box::new(|progress: ProcessingProgress| {
    println!("Page {}/{}: {:?}",
        progress.current_page,
        progress.total_pages,
        progress.stage);
}) as DetailedProgressCallback);

let result = integration
    .process_pdf_to_extracted_doc_with_progress(&pdf_bytes, None, callback)
    .await?;
```
