        "text": "Version 1.90.0\nRust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: with no runtime or\ngarbage collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on\nembedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages.\nRust’s rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety\nand thread-safety — enabling you to eliminate many classes of\nbugs at compile-time.\nRust has great documentation, a friendly compiler with useful error\nmessages, and top-notch tooling — an integrated package manager\nand build tool, smart multi-editor support with auto-completion and\ntype inspections, an auto-formatter, and more.\nIn 2018, the Rust community decided to improve the programming experience\nfor a few distinct domains (see the 2018\nroadmap). For these, you can find many high-quality crates and some\nawesome guides on how to get started.\nWhip up a CLI tool quickly with Rust’s robust ecosystem.\nRust helps you maintain your app with confidence and distribute it with ease.\nUse Rust to supercharge your JavaScript, one module at a time.\nPublish to npm, bundle with webpack, and you’re off to the races.\nPredictable performance. Tiny resource footprint. Rock-solid reliability.\nRust is great for network services.\nTargeting low-resource devices?\nNeed low-level control without giving up high-level conveniences?\nRust has you covered.\nHundreds of companies around the world are using Rust in production\ntoday for fast, low-resource, cross-platform solutions. From startups to large\ncorporations, from embedded devices to scalable web services, Rust is a great fit.\nWe love documentation! Take a look at the books available online, as well as key blog posts and user guides.\nThe Rust community has a dedicated YouTube channel collecting a huge range of presentations and\ntutorials.\nRust is truly a community effort, and we welcome contribution from hobbyists and production users, from\nnewcomers and seasoned professionals. Come help us make the Rust experience even better!\nRust would not exist without the generous contributions of time, work, and resources from individuals and companies.

If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. If so, please join the 2% of readers who give to keep this resource available for all.\nAfter nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—created by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a non-profit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.\nMost readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 today—or consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you.\nAfter nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised— an oasis of free and collaborative knowledge. Today, we ask you to join the 2% of readers who support this space. If everyone reading this right now gave just $2.75, we'd reach our goal quickly.\n— The Wikimedia Foundation, host of Wikipedia and its sister sites.\nWikipedia\n\nThe Free Encyclopedia\n1,000,000+\n\n\narticles\n100,000+\n\n\narticles\n10,000+\n\n\narticles\n1,000+\n\n\narticles\n100+\n\n\narticles\nThe internet we were promised\nالعربية\nDeutsch\nEnglish\nEspañol\nفارسی\nFrançais\nItaliano\nمصرى\nNederlands\n日本語\nPolski\nPortuguês\nSinugboanong Binisaya\nSvenska\nУкраїнська\nTiếng Việt\nWinaray\n中文\nРусский\nAfrikaans\nShqip\nAsturianu\nAzərbaycanca\nБългарски\n閩南語 / Bân-lâm-gú\nবাংলা\nБеларуская\nCatalà\nČeština\nCymraeg\nDansk\nEesti\nΕλληνικά\nEsperanto\nEuskara\nGalego\n한국어\nՀայերեն\nहिन्दी\nHrvatski\nBahasa Indonesia\nעברית\nქართული\nLadin\nLatina\nLatviešu\nLietuvių\nMagyar\nМакедонски\nMalagasy\nमराठी\nBahasa Melayu\nBahaso Minangkabau\nမြန်မာဘာသာ\nNorskbokmålnynorsk\nbokmål\nnynorsk\nНохчийн\nOʻzbekcha / Ўзбекча\nҚазақша / Qazaqşa / قازاقشا\nRomână\nSimple English\nSlovenčina\nSlovenščina\nСрпски / Srpski\nSrpskohrvatski / Српскохрватски\nSuomi\nKiswahili\nதமிழ்\nТатарча / Tatarça\nతెలుగు\nภาษาไทย\nТоҷикӣ\nتۆرکجه\nTürkçe\nاردو\n粵語\nBahsa Acèh\nAlemannisch\nአማርኛ\nAragonés\nԱրեւմտահայերէն\nBahasa Hulontalo\nBasa Bali\nBahasa Banjar\nBasa Banyumasan\nБашҡортса\nБеларуская (тарашкевіца)\nBikol Central\nবিষ্ণুপ্রিয়া মণিপুরী\nBoarisch\nBosanski\nBrezhoneg\nЧӑвашла\nDagbanli\nالدارجة\nDiné Bizaad\nEmigliàn–Rumagnòl\nFiji Hindi\nFøroyskt\nFrysk\nFulfulde\nGaeilge\nGàidhlig\nگیلکی\nગુજરાતી\nHak-kâ-ngî / 客家語\nHausa\nHornjoserbsce\nIdo\nIgbo\nIlokano\nInterlingua\nInterlingue\nИрон\nÍslenska\nJawa\nಕನ್ನಡ\nKapampangan\nភាសាខ្មែរ\nKotava\nKreyòl Ayisyen\nKurdî / كوردی\nکوردیی ناوەندی\nКыргызча\nКырык мары\nLëtzebuergesch\nLìgure\nLimburgs\nLombard\nमैथिली\nമലയാളം\nმარგალური\nمازِرونی\nMìng-dĕ̤ng-ngṳ̄ / 閩東語\nМонгол\nNapulitano\nनेपाल भाषा\nनेपाली\nNordfriisk\nOccitan\nОлык марий\nଓଡି଼ଆ\nঅসমীযা়\nਪੰਜਾਬੀ\nپنجابی (شاہ مکھی)\nپښتو\nPiemontèis\nPlattdüütsch\nQaraqalpaqsha\nQırımtatarca\nRuna Simi\nРусиньскый\nसंस्कृतम्\nᱥᱟᱱᱛᱟᱲᱤ\nسرائیکی\nСаха Тыла\nScots\nChiShona\nSicilianu\nසිංහල\nسنڌي\nŚlůnski\nBasa Sunda\nTaclḥit\nTagalog\nၽႃႇသႃႇတႆး\nⵜⴰⵎⴰⵣⵉⵖⵜ ⵜⴰⵏⴰⵡⴰⵢⵜ\ntolışi\nchiTumbuka\nBasa Ugi\nVèneto\nVolapük\nWalon\n文言\n吴语\nייִדיש\nYorùbá\nZazaki\nžemaitėška\nisiZulu\nꯃꯤꯇꯩ ꯂꯣꯟ\nDzhudezmo / לאדינו\nАдыгэбзэ\nÆnglisc\nAnarâškielâ\nअंगिका\nАԥсшәа\narmãneashti\nArpitan\natikamekw\nܐܬܘܪܝܐ\nAvañe’ẽ\nАвар\nAymar\nBatak Toba\nBetawi\nभोजपुरी\nBislama\nབོད་ཡིག\nБуряад\nChavacano de Zamboanga\nChichewa\nCorsu\nVahcuengh / 話僮\nDagaare\nDavvisámegiella\nDeitsch\nދިވެހިބަސް\nDolnoserbski\nDusun Bundu-liwan\nЭрзянь\nEstremeñu\nEʋegbe\nFarefare\nFɔ̀ngbè\nFurlan\nGaelg\nGagauz\nГӀалгӀай\nGhanaian Pidgin\nGĩkũyũ\n赣语 / 贛語\nGungbe\nХальмг\nʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi\nIkinyarwanda\nJaku Iban\nKabɩyɛ\nYerwa Kanuri\nKaszëbsczi\nKernewek\nКоми\nПерем коми\nKongo\nकोंकणी / Konknni\nكٲشُر\nKriyòl Gwiyannen\nKumoring\nKʋsaal\nພາສາລາວ\nЛакку\nLatgaļu\nЛезги\nLi Niha\nLingála\nLingua Franca Nova\nlivvinkarjala\nlojban\nLuganda\nMadhurâ\nMalti\nMandailing\nMāori\nMfantse\nMirandés\nМокшень\nဘာသာ မန်\nMoore\nߒߞߏ\nNa Vosa Vaka-Viti\nNāhuatlahtōlli\nNaijá\nNedersaksisch\nNouormand / Normaund\nNovial\nAfaan Oromoo\nပအိုဝ်ႏဘာႏသာႏ\nपालि\nPangasinán\nPangcah\nPapiamentu\nPatois\nPfälzisch\nPicard\nКъарачай–малкъар\nRipoarisch\nRumantsch\nSakizaya\nGagana Sāmoa\nSardu\nSeediq\nSeeltersk\nSesotho\nSesotho sa Leboa\nSetswana\nꠍꠤꠟꠐꠤ\nСловѣ́ньскъ / ⰔⰎⰑⰂⰡⰐⰠⰔⰍⰟ\nSoomaaliga\nSranantongo\nSiSwati\nReo tahiti\nTaqbaylit\nTarandíne\nTayal\nTetun\nTok Pisin\nfaka Tonga\nᏣᎳᎩ\nTürkmençe\nTwi\nTyap\nТыва дыл\nУдмурт\nئۇيغۇرچه\nVepsän\nvõro\nWest-Vlams\nWolof\nisiXhosa\nZeêuws\nалтай тил\nअवधी\nडोटेली\nತುಳು\nBajau Sama\nBamanankan\nChamoru\nརྫོང་ཁ\n𐌲𐌿𐍄𐌹𐍃𐌺\nIgala\nᐃᓄᒃᑎᑐᑦ / Inuktitut\nIñupiak\nisiNdebele seSewula\nKalaallisut\nNupe\nObolo\npinayuanan\nΠοντιακά\nromani čhib\nIkirundi\nруски\nSängö\nᥖᥭᥰᥖᥬᥳᥑᥨᥒᥰ\nትግርኛ\nThuɔŋjäŋ\nTsėhesenėstsestotse\nXitsonga\nTshivenḓa\nWayuunaiki\nадыгабзэ\nရခိုင်",

Today we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. If so, please join the 2% of readers who give to keep this resource available for all.\n\nAfter nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—created by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a non-profit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.\n\nMost readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 today—or consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you.\n\nAfter nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised— an oasis of free and collaborative knowledge. Today, we ask you to join the 2% of readers who support this space. If everyone reading this right now gave just $2.75, we'd reach our goal quickly.\n\n— The Wikimedia Foundation, host of Wikipedia and its sister sites.\n\nSave your favorite articles to read offline, sync your reading lists across devices and customize your reading experience with the official Wikipedia app.\n\nThis page is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\n\n## 1,000,000+\n\n\narticles\n\n## 100,000+\n\n\narticles\n\n## 10,000+\n\n\narticles\n\n## 1,000+\n\n\narticles\n\n## 100+\n\n\narticles\n\n### The internet we were promised\n\n",
