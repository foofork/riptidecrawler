   - Location: `/wasm/riptide-extractor-wasm/src/extraction.rs`

2. **📊 Fix Memory Tracking - COMPLETE**
   - Host-side ResourceLimiter implementation
   - Memory metrics: current_pages, peak_pages, grow_failures
   - Exported at `/metrics` endpoint
   - Location: `/crates/riptide-core/src/component.rs`

3. **🚀 Enable SIMD - COMPLETE**
   - Added `+simd128` for 10-25% performance boost
   - Configured in `.cargo/config.toml`
   - Additional optimizations: bulk-memory, sign-ext, LTO

4. **💾 AOT Cache - IMPLEMENTED**
   - Module precompilation support in component.rs
   - Target: 50ms → <15ms cold start
   - Cache configuration available

### ✅ Day 2-3: Production Hardening

5. **🔄 Instance Pooling - COMPLETE**
   - Semaphore-based concurrency control
   - Store-per-call with proper isolation

6. **🛡️ Add Fallback - COMPLETE**
   - Circuit breaker pattern implementation
   - Native readability-rs fallback
   - Graceful degradation without panics
   - Location: `/crates/riptide-core/src/pool_health.rs`

7. **🧪 Golden Tests - COMPLETE**
   - Comprehensive test suite created
   - Fixtures for various content types
   - Performance benchmarks included
   - Location: `/wasm/riptide-extractor-wasm/tests/`

## 📊 Key Implementation Details

### Extraction Features (`extraction.rs`)
```rust
✅ extract_links() - Full <a> tag extraction with attributes
✅ extract_media() - Images, videos, audio, favicons
✅ detect_language() - Multi-strategy language detection
✅ extract_categories() - JSON-LD, breadcrumbs, meta tags
```

### Memory Tracking (`component.rs`)
```rust
✅ WasmResourceTracker - Tracks memory pages and growth
✅ current_memory_pages() - Current usage monitoring
✅ grow_failures() - Failure tracking for circuit breaker
✅ peak_memory_pages() - Peak usage monitoring
```

### Instance Pool (`instance_pool.rs`)
```rust
✅ Semaphore concurrency control
✅ Fresh Store per invocation
✅ Warm pool pre-instantiation
✅ Automatic instance recycling
```

### SIMD Optimizations (`.cargo/config.toml`)
```toml
✅ target-feature=+simd128
✅ target-feature=+bulk-memory
✅ opt-level=s with LTO
✅ Strip symbols for size reduction
```

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria Status
