# Real-World Testing Findings - RipTide EventMesh

**Date**: 2025-10-11
**Test Phase**: Initial Real-World URL Testing
**Status**: ⚠️ Critical Issues Identified

---

## Executive Summary

Real-world testing revealed that **all extraction methods are returning mock data** despite comprehensive TDD implementation of gap fixes. The core issue is that the actual extraction logic has not been connected to the WASM runtime.

---

## Test Results

### Quick Validation Tests (3 URLs)

| URL | Expected Behavior | Actual Behavior | Status |
|-----|-------------------|-----------------|---------|
| https://example.com | Extract "Example Domain" title | Returned "Mock Title" | ❌ FAIL |
| https://docs.rs | Extract actual page title | Returned "Mock Title" | ❌ FAIL |
| https://lite.cnn.com | Extract CNN article title | Returned "Mock Title" | ❌ FAIL |

### Unit Tests Status

| Component | Tests | Status | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------|
| Confidence Scoring | 14/14 | ✅ PASS | Working correctly |
| Cache Keys | 9/9 | ✅ PASS | Working correctly |
| Strategy Composition | 2/2 | ✅ PASS | Framework works |
| WASM Memory | 12/12 | ✅ PASS | Management works |
| WASM Binding | 0/10 | ❌ FAIL | Mock detection failing (fuel not configured) |

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Trek Strategy Returns Mock Data** ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
- **Location**: `/workspaces/eventmesh/crates/riptide-core/src/strategies/implementations.rs:26`
- **Issue**: Hardcoded to return "Mock Title" with comment "Trek extraction moved to riptide-html, returning mock result"
- **Impact**: All extraction requests using Trek strategy return fake data
- **Fix Applied**: ✅ Implemented basic HTML parsing (title extraction, content cleanup)
- **Status**: Needs rebuild and retest

### 2. **WASM Extractor Not Invoked** ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
- **Location**: `/workspaces/eventmesh/crates/riptide-html/src/wasm_extraction.rs:467-478`
- **Issue**: Returns mock ExtractedDoc instead of invoking WASM component
- **Root Cause**: Missing WASM component binding:
  - No `bindgen!()` macro for WIT bindings
  - No `Linker` configuration
  - No `instantiate()` call
  - No `call_extract()` invocation
- **Impact**: WASM runtime exists but is never used
- **Fix Status**: ❌ Not implemented (documented in guide)

### 3. **API Server Infrastructure** ✅ WORKING
- **Health Check**: Responds correctly
- **Core Dependencies**: Redis, HTTP client, extractor all healthy
- **Metrics**: CPU, memory, connections tracked correctly
- **Status**: Infrastructure is solid, extraction logic needs fixing

---

## What Doesn't Work

### Extraction ❌
- **All extraction methods return mock data**
- Trek strategy hardcoded to return "Mock Title"
- WASM component never invoked
- No actual HTML parsing happening in production path

### WASM Runtime ❌
- Engine configured but unused
- Fuel limits defined but not enforced (no fuel in store)
- Component exists but no invocation path
- Resource tracking in place but nothing to track

---

## Critical Path to Production

### Phase 1: Fix Trek Strategy (IMMEDIATE)
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED (needs rebuild/test)
- Implemented basic HTML parsing
- Title extraction from `<title>` tags
- Content cleanup (remove scripts, styles, tags)
- Summary generation

**Next Steps**:
1. Rebuild project: `cargo build --workspace`
2. Restart API server
3. Retest with real URLs
4. Validate extraction quality

### Phase 2: Complete WASM Binding (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Estimated Time**: ~70 minutes
**Guide**: `/workspaces/eventmesh/docs/WASM_BINDING_COMPLETION_GUIDE.md`

**Steps**:
1. Generate WIT bindings (5 min)
2. Configure Linker (10 min)
3. Implement invocation (45 min)
4. Verify tests pass (10 min)

**Blockers**: None - all infrastructure ready

### Phase 3: Integrate & Test (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

**Tasks**:
1. Connect WASM extractor to Trek strategy
2. Full URL test suite (30 URLs × 8 methods = 240 tests)
3. PDF extraction validation
4. CLI command testing
5. Performance benchmarking
6. Generate comparison reports

## Recommended Action Plan

### Option A: Quick Fix (Recommended for Immediate Testing)
**Timeline**: 30 minutes
1. ✅ Use current Trek HTML parsing fix
2. Rebuild and restart server
3. Run 5-URL validation test
4. Document results vs. mock data

**Pros**: Fast, allows real-world testing today
**Cons**: Not using WASM, simpler parsing

### Option B: Complete WASM Implementation (Recommended for Production)
**Timeline**: 2-3 hours
1. Follow WASM binding guide
2. Implement all 4 phases
3. Full test suite
4. Production validation

**Pros**: Complete solution, high-quality extraction
**Cons**: Longer timeline

### Option C: Parallel Approach
**Timeline**: 3-4 hours
1. Test with current HTML parsing fix NOW
2. Implement WASM binding in parallel
3. Compare results (basic vs WASM extraction)
4. Choose best approach for production

**Pros**: Data-driven decision, both options ready
**Cons**: Most time-consuming

- **9 cache key tests** passing
- **12 WASM memory tests** passing
- **2 strategy composition tests** passing

### Integration Tests ⚠️
- **15+ tests created** but not executable yet

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable (Quick Fix)
- [ ] Trek strategy extracts actual titles from HTML
- [ ] Content cleaned of scripts/styles
- [ ] 5 test URLs return unique titles
- [ ] Quality scores reflect actual content

### Production Ready (Complete Fix)
- [ ] WASM component binding complete
- [ ] All 8 extraction methods functional
- [ ] 30 URL test suite >80% success rate
- [ ] PDF extraction operational
- [ ] CLI commands validated
- [ ] Performance meets targets (<500ms per extraction)

---

## Metrics & Performance

### Current State
- **Build Time**: ~1m 18s (dev), ~2m+ (release timeout)
- **Test Execution**: <1s for passing unit tests
- **API Response Time**: 739ms (with mock data)
- **Memory Usage**: 168MB (API server)

### Expected After Fix
- **API Response Time**: <500ms (Trek), <200ms (CSS), <100ms (Regex)
- **Extraction Accuracy**: >90% for static HTML, >80% for all content
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >80% with proper cache keys
- **Confidence Scores**: Meaningful 0.0-1.0 range

---

## Conclusion

The infrastructure is solid, the gap fixes are implemented and tested at the unit level, but **the extraction logic is not connected**. We have two mock data insertion points:

1. **Trek strategy** (riptide-core) - ✅ FIXED with HTML parsing
2. **WASM extractor** (riptide-html) - ❌ NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION

**Immediate Next Step**: Rebuild project with Trek fix and test with real URLs to validate the basic HTML extraction works before investing time in WASM binding implementation.
