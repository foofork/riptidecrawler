## Risk Assessment

### Design Risks

| Risk | Status | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Design too complex | ✅ Low | Designs are detailed but clear |
| Missing critical info | ✅ Low | 30/30 checklist items complete |
| Not actionable | ✅ Low | Day-by-day tasks with commands |
| Stakeholder rejection | ⚠️ Medium | Review and iterate based on feedback |

### Implementation Risks

| Risk | Status | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| One-shot migration fails | ⚠️ Medium | Rollback strategy documented |
| Quality gate too strict | ⚠️ Low | Binary criteria but achievable |
| Timeline slippage | ⚠️ Medium | 20% buffer included in estimates |
| Documentation incomplete | ✅ Low | Day 5 dedicated to docs + ADR |

**Overall Risk**: ⚠️ Medium (manageable with mitigation strategies)
