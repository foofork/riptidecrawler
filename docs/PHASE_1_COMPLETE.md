## 🎯 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT PHASE

### Immediate
1. ✅ **Proceed to next development phase** - No blockers
2. 📝 **Update documentation** - Reflect accurate project status
3. 🧪 **Run full test suite** - On machine with faster builds (optional)

### Short-Term
1. 🔄 **Create riptide-wasm crate** - Professional recommendation
2. 📚 **Consolidate WASM docs** - Merge into unified guide
3. 🧪 **AppState test helper** - Fix 1 ignored test

### Medium-Term
1. 🎨 **CLI enhancements** - 8 nice-to-have features
2. 📖 **Add missing READMEs** - development/, testing/ subdirectories
3. 🔄 **Documentation maintenance** - Keep in sync with code

---

## 💡 KEY LEARNINGS

1. **Trust but verify**: Documentation can become outdated quickly
2. **Code first**: The codebase was much better than docs suggested
3. **Intentional ignores**: Many #[ignore] tests are by design
4. **Feature flags**: "Dead code" often just feature-gated
5. **Build times**: CI environment limitations affect verification
