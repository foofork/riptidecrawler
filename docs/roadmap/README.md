## ⭐ THE ROADMAP (Single Source of Truth)

### **[RIPTIDE-V1-DEFINITIVE-ROADMAP.md](./RIPTIDE-V1-DEFINITIVE-ROADMAP.md)**

**This is THE roadmap to follow. All other roadmaps are superseded.**

**Status:** ✅ Validated (95% confidence)
**Timeline:** 18 weeks to production-ready v1.0
**Validation:** 4-agent swarm verification complete

**What makes it definitive:**
- ✅ Validated by 4 specialized agents (architect, analyzer, planner, reviewer)
- ✅ 98% codebase alignment verified
- ✅ All syntax errors corrected (async trait issues fixed)
- ✅ Timeline adjusted to realistic 18 weeks
- ✅ Every line count verified (within 2 lines of actual code!)
- ✅ All file paths verified to exist
- ✅ Explicit enough to execute without asking questions

**Can users:**
1. ✅ Extract in 1 line? `client.extract(url)`
2. ✅ Spider without extract? `client.spider(url)`
3. ✅ Extract without spider? `client.extract_html(html)`
4. ✅ Compose flexibly? `client.spider(url).and_extract()`
5. ✅ Use from Python? `pip install riptide`

**If yes to all 5 → Ship v1.0 🚀**

## 🔍 Document Evolution

**RIPTIDE-V1-DEFINITIVE-ROADMAP.md** was created through multiple iterations:

1. **Original Vision** - Established "refactor not rewrite" principle
2. **Ground Truth Analysis** - 7 agents found hidden production code (1,596 lines)
3. **UX Layer Added** - Added user experience design and Python SDK
4. **Validation & Correction** - 4-agent swarm validated and corrected all errors

**Final Result:**
- ✅ All syntax errors corrected (async trait issues fixed)
- ✅ Timeline adjusted to realistic 18 weeks
- ✅ 98% codebase alignment verified
- ✅ Explicit implementation details
- ✅ Ready to execute

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T:
1. **Skip validation reports** - They explain critical corrections
2. **Ignore the analysis documents** - They provide essential context
3. **Skip Week 0 setup** - Foundation is critical for success

### ✅ DO:
1. **Follow RIPTIDE-V1-DEFINITIVE-ROADMAP.md exclusively**
2. **Read VALIDATION-SYNTHESIS.md** to understand corrections
3. **Reference analysis documents** for deep dives
4. **Execute tasks in the order specified**
