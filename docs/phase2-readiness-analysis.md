- ✅ Build system is stable (0 errors, minimal warnings)
- ✅ 20 crates in workspace with clear dependency structure
- ✅ 226 test files with comprehensive coverage
- ⚠️ Dependencies on Phase 1 architecture refactoring (P1-A3, P1-A4) - NOT YET COMPLETE
- 🔴 **BLOCKER**: P1-A3 core refactoring and P1-A4 facade layer must complete before Phase 2

---

## 📋 Phase 1 Completion Status

   - CDP connection pooling
   - Batch operations

### Medium-Term (Weeks 7-12)

1. **Execute Phase 2 Testing**
   - Follow detailed plans for P2-D1-D6
   - Maintain quality gates
   - Document all findings

2. **Code Cleanup**
   - Remove dead code
   - Fix remaining clippy warnings (only 4!)
   - Improve documentation

3. **Monitoring & Optimization**
   - Set up dashboards
   - Configure alerts
