## Critical Compilation Errors

### 1. riptide-stealth (BLOCKING)

**File:** `crates/riptide-stealth/src/behavior.rs`

**Errors:**
```rust
error[E0433]: failed to resolve: could not find `SmallRng` in `rngs`
  --> crates/riptide-stealth/src/behavior.rs:79:30
   |
79 |             rng: rand::rngs::SmallRng::from_entropy(),
   |                              ^^^^^^^^ could not find `SmallRng` in `rngs`

error[E0412]: cannot find type `SmallRng` in module `rand::rngs`
  --> crates/riptide-stealth/src/behavior.rs:25:22
   |
25 |     rng: rand::rngs::SmallRng,
   |                      ^^^^^^^^ not found in `rand::rngs`

warning: unused import: `SeedableRng`
  --> crates/riptide-stealth/src/behavior.rs:13:17
   |
13 | use rand::{Rng, SeedableRng};
   |                 ^^^^^^^^^^^
```

**Root Cause:** Missing `small_rng` feature flag for the `rand` crate

**Fix Required:** Add to `crates/riptide-stealth/Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
rand = { version = "0.8", features = ["small_rng"] }
```

## Categorized Issues

### üî¥ Critical (Blocking)
1. **riptide-stealth**: Missing `small_rng` feature - BLOCKS COMPILATION
   - Impact: Cannot build, cannot test
   - Priority: IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED

### üü° High Priority (Environment)
2. **riptide-headless**: Missing Chrome executable (15 test failures)
   - Impact: All integration tests fail
   - Solution: Install Chrome or mock browser

3. **riptide-pdf**: Missing libpdfium.so (2 test failures)
   - Impact: PDF processing tests fail
   - Solution: Install pdfium or mock library

### üü¢ Medium Priority (Logic)
4. **riptide-core**: 15+ test failures in spider/fetch components
   - Types: BM25 scoring, circuit breaker, URL normalization
   - Need detailed investigation

5. **riptide-html**: 3 chunking test failures + 2 performance timeouts
   - Safe split points, boundary detection, regex chunking

6. **riptide-search**: 1 circuit breaker test failure
   - Assertion failure in threshold test

   - May need longer timeout or optimization

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Information
9. **riptide-persistence**: No tests implemented
   - Consider adding test coverage

10. **riptide-api**: Build timeout
    - Need to investigate compilation performance
