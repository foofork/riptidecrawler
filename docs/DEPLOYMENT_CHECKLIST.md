## Deployment Steps

### 1. Copy WASM Binary to Deployment Location

```bash
# Create deployment directory
sudo mkdir -p /opt/riptide/wasm

# Copy WASM binary
sudo cp /workspaces/eventmesh/target/wasm32-wasip2/release/riptide_extractor_wasm.wasm \
   /opt/riptide/wasm/riptide_extractor_wasm.wasm

# Set permissions
sudo chmod 644 /opt/riptide/wasm/riptide_extractor_wasm.wasm

# Verify
ls -lh /opt/riptide/wasm/riptide_extractor_wasm.wasm
wasm-tools validate /opt/riptide/wasm/riptide_extractor_wasm.wasm
```

### 2. Configure Application

**File**: `config/production.yaml` or environment variables

```yaml
extraction:
  # WASM Configuration
  wasm_module_path: "/opt/riptide/wasm/riptide_extractor_wasm.wasm"
  enable_wasm: true
  enable_aot_cache: true

  # Resource Limits
  max_memory_pages: 1024        # 64MB (1024 * 64KB)
  extraction_timeout: 30         # seconds

  # Instance Pool
  instance_pool_size: 8          # concurrent instances
  max_idle_time: 300            # seconds

  # Circuit Breaker
  circuit_breaker:
    failure_threshold: 5
    recovery_timeout: 5          # seconds
    success_threshold: 1
    enable_fallback: true        # native extraction on failure

  # Performance
  enable_simd: true              # WASM SIMD optimizations
```

**Environment Variables** (alternative):
```bash
export RIPTIDE_WASM_PATH="/opt/riptide/wasm/riptide_extractor_wasm.wasm"
export RIPTIDE_ENABLE_WASM=true
export RIPTIDE_WASM_MAX_MEMORY_PAGES=1024
export RIPTIDE_WASM_TIMEOUT=30
```

### 3. Deploy Application Binary

```bash
# Build release binary
cargo build --release

# Copy to deployment location
sudo cp target/release/riptide-api /opt/riptide/bin/
sudo cp target/release/riptide-workers /opt/riptide/bin/

# Set permissions
sudo chmod 755 /opt/riptide/bin/riptide-api
sudo chmod 755 /opt/riptide/bin/riptide-workers
```

### 4. Update Systemd Services (if applicable)

**File**: `/etc/systemd/system/riptide-api.service`

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Riptide API Server with WASM Extraction
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=riptide
Group=riptide
WorkingDirectory=/opt/riptide
ExecStart=/opt/riptide/bin/riptide-api
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5s

# Environment
Environment="RIPTIDE_WASM_PATH=/opt/riptide/wasm/riptide_extractor_wasm.wasm"
Environment="RIPTIDE_ENABLE_WASM=true"
Environment="RUST_LOG=info"

# Resource limits for the service
LimitNOFILE=65536
LimitNPROC=4096

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**Reload and restart**:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart riptide-api
sudo systemctl status riptide-api
```

### 5. Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check WASM binary is accessible
test -f /opt/riptide/wasm/riptide_extractor_wasm.wasm && echo "✅ WASM binary found"

# Check application is running
systemctl is-active riptide-api && echo "✅ Service active"

# Test extraction endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/extract \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "mode": "article"
  }' | jq .

# Expected: Successful extraction with links, media, language, categories
```

---

## Monitoring Setup

### 1. Prometheus Metrics

**Metrics to track**:
```yaml
# Memory metrics
riptide_wasm_memory_pages (current usage)
riptide_wasm_peak_memory_pages (peak tracking)
riptide_wasm_grow_failed_total (allocation failures)

# Performance metrics
riptide_wasm_cold_start_time_ms (startup time)
riptide_wasm_extraction_time_ms (processing time)
riptide_wasm_extraction_total (total count)

# Health metrics
riptide_wasm_circuit_breaker_state (Closed/Open/HalfOpen)
riptide_wasm_extraction_success_total (successful extractions)
riptide_wasm_extraction_failure_total (failed extractions)
riptide_wasm_extraction_success_rate (percentage)
```

### 2. Alerting Rules

```yaml
# Alert on high memory usage
- alert: WasmHighMemoryUsage
  expr: riptide_wasm_memory_pages > 900  # >56MB of 64MB limit
  for: 5m
  annotations:
    summary: "WASM memory usage approaching limit"

# Alert on circuit breaker open
- alert: WasmCircuitBreakerOpen
  expr: riptide_wasm_circuit_breaker_state == 1  # 1 = Open
  for: 1m
  annotations:
    summary: "WASM circuit breaker open, using fallback"

# Alert on high failure rate
- alert: WasmHighFailureRate
  expr: rate(riptide_wasm_extraction_failure_total[5m]) > 0.05  # >5% failures
  for: 5m
  annotations:
    summary: "WASM extraction failure rate elevated"
```

### 3. Grafana Dashboard

**Key panels**:
- Extraction throughput (requests/sec)
- Success rate (percentage)
- Cold start latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Memory usage (current, peak)
- Circuit breaker state
- Feature extraction stats (links, media, language, categories)

---

## Performance Targets

### Expected Performance

| Metric | Target | Threshold |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Cold start time | <15ms | Alert >50ms |
| Warm extraction time | <5ms | Alert >20ms |
| Memory usage | <64MB | Alert >60MB |
| Success rate | >95% | Alert <90% |
| Circuit breaker | Closed | Alert if Open >1min |

---

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Arise

1. **Disable WASM extraction** (immediate fallback to native):
   ```bash
   # Set environment variable
   export RIPTIDE_ENABLE_WASM=false

   # Or update config
   sed -i 's/enable_wasm: true/enable_wasm: false/' config/production.yaml

   # Restart service
   sudo systemctl restart riptide-api
   ```

2. **Verify fallback working**:
   ```bash
   # Check logs for fallback messages
   journalctl -u riptide-api -f | grep "fallback"

   # Test extraction still works
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/extract \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"url": "https://example.com", "mode": "article"}'
   ```

3. **Investigate issues**:
   ```bash
   # Check WASM binary
   wasm-tools validate /opt/riptide/wasm/riptide_extractor_wasm.wasm

   # Check application logs
   journalctl -u riptide-api -n 1000 | grep -i "wasm\|error"

   # Check metrics
   curl http://localhost:9090/metrics | grep riptide_wasm
   ```

---

## Post-Deployment Validation

### Automated Tests

```bash
# Run smoke tests
./scripts/smoke-test.sh production

# Expected checks:
# ✅ Service health endpoint responds
# ✅ Extraction endpoint processes requests
# ✅ WASM extraction returns valid data
# ✅ Links, media, language, categories present
# ✅ Response time within targets
# ✅ No errors in logs
```

### Manual Validation

1. **Test article extraction**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/extract \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "url": "https://www.example.com/article",
       "mode": "article"
     }' | jq '{
       title: .title,
       links_count: (.links | length),
       media_count: (.media | length),
       language: .language,
       categories_count: (.categories | length)
     }'
   ```

2. **Verify metrics**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:9090/metrics | grep riptide_wasm
   ```

3. **Check logs for WASM activity**:
   ```bash
   journalctl -u riptide-api -f | grep WASM
   ```

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "WASM component not found"
```bash
# Solution: Verify path
ls -l $RIPTIDE_WASM_PATH
# Ensure path matches configuration
```

**Issue**: "Component instantiation failed"
```bash
# Solution: Validate WASM binary
wasm-tools validate $RIPTIDE_WASM_PATH
# Check permissions
```

**Issue**: "Memory limit exceeded"
```bash
# Solution: Increase memory pages
# config.yaml: max_memory_pages: 2048  # 128MB
```

**Issue**: "Circuit breaker open"
```bash
# Solution: Check error logs and metrics
# Investigate root cause (timeout, memory, errors)
# Circuit breaker will auto-recover after success_threshold
```
