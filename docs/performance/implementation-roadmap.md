# RipTide Zero-Impact AI Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap transforms RipTide from accepting a 25-30% performance penalty to achieving a 15% performance improvement when AI features are enabled, while reducing costs by 75%.

## Implementation Strategy

### Core Principle: "Enhance, Don't Replace"

The key insight is that AI should **enhance** the existing fast CSS extraction rather than **replace** it. This approach:

1. Maintains baseline performance for all users
2. Provides immediate results via CSS extraction
3. Enhances results asynchronously via AI when beneficial
4. Eliminates the false choice between speed and intelligence

## Conclusion

This roadmap transforms the RipTide performance "trade-off" into a performance "advantage":

- **Week 2**: Recover 40% of lost throughput (70 â†’ 98 pages/minute)
- **Week 5**: Achieve cost parity through caching (80% API reduction)
- **Week 7**: Exceed baseline performance (100 â†’ 110 pages/minute)
- **Week 10**: Deliver production system with 15% improvement + 75% cost reduction

The key insight is architectural: AI should enhance rather than replace fast extraction, running asynchronously to provide the best of both worlds - speed AND intelligence.
