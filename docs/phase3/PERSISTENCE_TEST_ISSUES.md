# Persistence Test Compilation Issues

Generated: 2025-10-10

## Summary

The `riptide-persistence/tests/persistence_tests.rs` file contains 18 compilation errors due to API mismatches between the tests and the actual implementation.

## Root Cause

The persistence module has undergone significant architectural changes:
- Storage backends have been redesigned
- Public APIs have changed
- Internal modules are no longer exported
- Method signatures have been updated

## Detailed Issues

### 1. Missing Storage Module Exports (Lines 9, 106, 148)
```rust
// Test code expects:
use riptide_persistence::storage::{DatabaseStorage, FileStorage, StorageBackend};
use riptide_persistence::queue::{PersistentQueue, QueueConfig};
use riptide_persistence::checkpoint::{CheckpointManager, CrawlState};

// Issue: These modules are not publicly exported
```

### 2. Undefined Types (Lines 37, 59, 71, 75, 81, 132)
```rust
// Tests reference types that don't exist:
- CrawlRecord
- CacheConfig (ambiguous - multiple definitions)
- PersistentCache
- PriorityQueue
```

### 3. Private API Usage (Lines 152, 175, 193)
```rust
// CheckpointManager::new is private
let manager = CheckpointManager::new("/tmp/riptide_checkpoints")

// Methods are private or don't exist:
- save_checkpoint()
- restore_checkpoint()
- cleanup_old_checkpoints()
```

### 4. Type Mismatches (Lines 152, 175)
```rust
// Expected StateConfig, got &str
CheckpointManager::new("/tmp/riptide_checkpoints")
// Should be:
CheckpointManager::new(StateConfig { /* ... */ })
```

## Resolution Options

### Option 1: Update Tests to Match Current API (Recommended)
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

1. Read the current `riptide-persistence/src/lib.rs` to understand exported APIs
2. Read `state.rs` to understand CheckpointManager's actual API
3. Rewrite tests to use the current public APIs
4. Add integration tests for state management

**Benefits**:
- Tests will reflect actual usage patterns
- Catches any remaining API issues
- Provides documentation via examples

### Option 2: Temporarily Disable Tests
**Estimated Time**: 5 minutes

Add `#[ignore]` to all failing tests or disable the test file:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
#[cfg(not(test))] // Temporarily disable all tests
mod persistence_tests {
    // ...
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Unblocks compilation immediately
- Allows focus on other priorities

**Drawbacks**:
- Loss of test coverage
- Tests become outdated

### Option 3: Export Required APIs
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

Make internal APIs public to match test expectations:

```rust
// In src/lib.rs
pub mod storage;
pub mod queue;
pub mod checkpoint;
```

**Benefits**:
- Minimal test changes
- Preserves original test intent

**Drawbacks**:
- May expose implementation details
- Could lead to API instability

## Recommendation

**Proceed with Option 2 (temporarily disable) for now**, then implement Option 1 in a dedicated test modernization sprint.

**Rationale**:
1. The main crate compiles successfully
2. Clippy warnings are more critical (now fixed)
3. Test modernization requires careful API review
4. This unblocks immediate development

## Action Items

- [ ] Disable persistence tests temporarily (add #[ignore] or #[cfg(not(test))])
- [ ] Create issue to track test modernization
- [ ] Schedule 2-3 hour block to rewrite tests against current API
- [ ] Add integration tests for state management
- [ ] Document public API with examples
