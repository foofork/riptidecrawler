# RipTide EventMesh - Realistic Launch Roadmap

**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Goal**: Launch in 4 weeks
**Philosophy**: Ship a working product, iterate after launch

---

## Executive Summary

**The Problem**: Current master roadmap has 10-12 weeks of work including 117 file refactoring, advanced monitoring, A/B testing frameworks, and numerous enhancements.

**The Reality**: You need to launch NOW, not in 3 months.

**The Solution**: 4-week sprint to launch with **only** what's critical. Everything else goes to post-launch backlog.

---

## Launch Criteria (What "Done" Means)

A launchable product must have:

1. **Stability**: Core features work reliably
2. **Observability**: Basic monitoring to detect issues
3. **Operability**: Can deploy, restart, troubleshoot
4. **Documentation**: Users can understand and use it

**NOT required for launch**:
- Perfect code organization (technical debt is fine)
- Advanced features (A/B testing, auto-tuning, etc.)
- Comprehensive dashboards (one dashboard is enough)
- 100% test coverage (90% is fine if bugs aren't critical)

---

## Week 1: Stabilization (Days 1-7)

**Goal**: Get to 100% working state, fix critical bugs

### Day 1-2: Test Failures Investigation
**Current State**: 169/189 tests passing (89.4%)

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Identify which 20 tests are failing
- [ ] Categorize: Critical bugs vs environment issues vs flaky tests
- [ ] Fix ONLY critical bugs (P0 severity)

**Skip for now**: All P1/P2 TODOs (defer to post-launch)

### Day 5-6: Basic Monitoring Setup

**Minimal monitoring** (not the 4-dashboard extravaganza):
- [ ] Deploy Prometheus + Grafana (docker-compose)
- [ ] Create ONE dashboard with essentials:
  - Request count and error rate
  - Response latency (p50, p95, p99)
  - Extraction success rate
  - Memory/CPU usage
- [ ] Add ONE alert: error rate >5%

**Skip for now**:
- Gate analysis dashboard
- Quality dashboard
- Performance dashboard
- 8 alert rules
- Threshold tuning system
- A/B testing framework

### Day 7: Smoke Testing

- [ ] Deploy to staging environment

## What Gets Deferred to Post-Launch

### Refactoring (7-8 weeks)
**Defer ALL of it**:
- ❌ 117 files to refactor
- ❌ File length restrictions (<600 LOC)
- ❌ Module reorganization
- ❌ Code cleanup

**Why**: Technical debt doesn't prevent launch. Fix it incrementally after launch.

### Advanced Monitoring (2-3 weeks)
**Defer**:
- ❌ 4 specialized dashboards (gate analysis, quality, performance)
- ❌ 8 alert rules
- ❌ Threshold tuning system
- ❌ A/B testing framework
- ❌ Hot-reload configuration
- ❌ CLI threshold recommendation tool

**Why**: One dashboard is enough to start. Add more based on actual operational needs.

### Enhancement Features (2-3 weeks)
**Defer**:
- ❌ CSS Enhancement (60+ selectors)
- ❌ CETD algorithm
- ❌ +25-35% quality improvement project
- ❌ Quality benchmarking suite

**Why**: Current extraction works. Enhance based on real user feedback about quality issues.

### CLI Polish (1-2 weeks)
**Defer**:
- ❌ Shell completions (bash, zsh, fish, PowerShell)
- ❌ Config file support
- ❌ Man page generation
- ❌ Enhanced error messages
- ❌ Signal handling improvements

**Why**: CLI works. Polish it based on actual user pain points.

### Testing Infrastructure (1-2 weeks)
**Defer**:
- ❌ 40+ comprehensive integration tests
- ❌ Performance regression testing
- ❌ CI/CD pipeline
- ❌ Automated benchmarks

**Why**: Manual testing is fine for launch. Automate based on what breaks most often.

### Documentation Deep Dives (1-2 weeks)
**Defer**:
- ❌ Architecture deep dives
- ❌ Metrics catalog (30+ metrics)
- ❌ Performance tuning guides
- ❌ Runbooks for every scenario

**Why**: Basic docs are enough. Expand based on support questions.

## Risk Management

### Risk: Tests Failures Are Critical Bugs
**Mitigation**: Investigate failing tests Day 1-2. If critical bugs found, extend Week 1 stabilization.

### Risk: Production Issues at Launch
**Mitigation**: Start with 10% traffic if possible. Have rollback plan ready. Monitor closely Days 22-25.

### Risk: Incomplete Documentation
**Mitigation**: Focus on getting started guide and common use cases. Update docs based on user questions.

### Risk: Performance Issues at Scale
**Mitigation**: Load test at 100 RPS (current expected load). Scale improvements in post-launch iterations.

## Key Principles

1. **Ship Fast**: 4 weeks to launch beats 3 months of perfection
2. **Iterate**: Launch with basics, improve based on real usage
3. **Focus**: Only critical path items for launch
4. **Defer**: Technical debt and enhancements go to backlog
5. **Learn**: Real user feedback > theoretical improvements
