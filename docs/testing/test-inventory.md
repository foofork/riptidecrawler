# Test Inventory - EventMesh

**Generated:** 2025-10-17
**Baseline for:** Phase 1 & 2 Execution

## Overview

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total Test Files | 310 |
| Unit Tests (`#[test]`) | 898 |
| Async Tests (`#[tokio::test]`) | 1,376 |
| Integration Test Files | 121 |
| Benchmarks | 0 |
| **Total Test Cases** | **2,274** |

## Test Distribution by Type

### Unit Tests (898)
- Synchronous tests using `#[test]` attribute
- Fast, isolated tests for individual functions/methods
- Found across all crates

### Async Tests (1,376)
- Asynchronous tests using `#[tokio::test]` attribute
- Tests for async/await code, I/O operations, network calls
- Majority of test suite (60.5%)

### Integration Tests (121 files)
- Tests in `tests/` directories within crates
- End-to-end testing of crate functionality
- Test public API interfaces

### Benchmarks (0)
- No formal benchmarks found
- **Recommendation:** Add benchmarks for performance-critical paths
- Target: Add to Phase 2 performance optimization work

## Test Files by Location

├── riptide-api/           # API tests
├── riptide-core/          # Core functionality tests
├── riptide-extraction/    # Extraction algorithm tests

## Coverage Gaps (Pre-Baseline)

Based on architectural analysis:

1. **riptide-headless** - Low test coverage identified
2. **riptide-workers** - Limited worker pool tests
3. **Browser automation** - Missing integration tests
4. **Error handling paths** - Incomplete coverage
5. **Concurrent operations** - Need more stress tests

## Phase 2 Consolidation Plan

**Current:** 310 test files
**Target:** ~120-150 test files
**Strategy:**
- Merge duplicate test setups
- Consolidate small test files
- Group related tests by feature
- Remove redundant tests
- Maintain or improve coverage

## Test Execution Characteristics

**To be measured:**
- Total execution time
- Per-crate execution time
- Slowest tests (top 20)
- Flaky tests (intermittent failures)
- Parallel vs sequential performance

## Quality Metrics Baseline

**To be established:**
- Overall coverage: ~80% (estimated)
- Per-crate coverage: varies
- Test execution time: TBD
- CI/CD build time: TBD

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate (Phase 1):**
   - Generate coverage baseline
   - Identify critical gaps
   - Fix failing tests if any

2. **Phase 2:**
   - Consolidate 310 → 120-150 files
   - Improve coverage to >90%
   - Add benchmarks
   - Optimize slow tests
   - Eliminate flaky tests

3. **Ongoing:**
   - Maintain >90% coverage
   - Keep tests fast (<5min total)
   - Add tests for new features
   - Regular performance testing

**Next Steps:**
1. Run cargo-tarpaulin for coverage baseline
2. Execute full test suite with timing
3. Identify slow/flaky tests
4. Create detailed breakdown by crate
