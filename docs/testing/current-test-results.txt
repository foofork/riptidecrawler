COMPILATION BLOCKED - Cannot Execute Tests

Status: ❌ CRITICAL ERROR
Date: 2025-10-18 12:02:08

ERROR SUMMARY:
=============
File: crates/riptide-api/src/state.rs
Lines: 672, 1244

Compilation errors prevent test execution:
- Line 672: could not find `MetricsCollector` in `monitoring`
- Line 1244: could not find `PerformanceMetrics` in `monitoring`

Root Cause:
- riptide-monitoring extracted from riptide-core
- Import paths changed but not updated in riptide-api

Required Fix:
- Update imports: riptide_core::monitoring → riptide_monitoring::monitoring
- Update types: MetricsCollector, PerformanceMetrics

Impact:
- 665+ tests blocked
- 6 crates cannot compile
- 0% test pass rate
- P1 completion blocked

Action Required:
- CODER agent: Fix imports immediately
- See: /workspaces/eventmesh/docs/testing/URGENT-COMPILATION-FIX-NEEDED.md

Test Suite Inventory:
=====================
Total Test Files: 100+
Estimated Tests: 665+
Current Pass Rate: 0% (blocked)

Test Distribution:
- Unit tests: ~400 (60%)
- Integration tests: ~200 (30%)
- E2E tests: ~65 (10%)

Extracted Crates Status:
========================
riptide-monitoring: 10 source files, 0 tests
riptide-security: 8 source files, 0 tests
riptide-fetch: 5 source files, 0 tests

Required Tests:
- riptide-monitoring: 50+ unit, 10+ integration
- riptide-security: 40+ unit, 8+ integration
- riptide-fetch: 30+ unit, 5+ integration
Total: 120+ unit, 23+ integration tests needed

Next Steps:
===========
1. Fix compilation errors (CODER agent)
2. Run test suite: cargo test --workspace
3. Write extracted crate tests (TESTER agent)
4. Write integration tests (TESTER agent)
5. Achieve 90%+ coverage on extracted crates
