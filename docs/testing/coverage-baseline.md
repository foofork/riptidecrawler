# Test Coverage Baseline - EventMesh

**Generated:** 2025-10-17
**Status:** BLOCKED - Cannot measure coverage until build succeeds

## Executive Summary

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Coverage Measurement | ❌ BLOCKED |
| Build Status | ❌ FAILED (3 errors) |
| Test Execution | ❌ BLOCKED |
| Coverage Tools | ⏳ Installing |

## Estimated Current Coverage

Based on architectural analysis and test inventory:

**Estimated Overall:** ~80%

This estimate is based on:
- 2,274 test cases across 310 test files
- Good test distribution across crates
- Prior architectural analysis noting gaps

## Expected Coverage by Crate (Post-Fix)

### High Coverage Expected (>85%)
- **riptide-core:** Core functionality well-tested
- **riptide-extraction:** Extraction algorithms tested
- **riptide-spider:** Spider functionality tested
- **riptide-pdf:** PDF processing tested

### Medium Coverage Expected (70-85%)
- **riptide-api:** API endpoints partially tested
- **riptide-cli:** CLI commands partially tested
- **riptide-stealth:** Stealth features partially tested

### Low Coverage Identified (<70%)
- **riptide-headless:** Browser automation (identified gap)
- **riptide-workers:** Worker pool management (identified gap)
- **riptide-streaming:** Streaming functionality (needs verification)

## Coverage Gaps Identified

### Critical Gaps (From Architectural Analysis)

1. **Browser Automation (riptide-headless)**
   - Pool management edge cases
   - Health check scenarios
   - Concurrent browser operations
   - Memory limit enforcement (Phase 1 additions)
   - Tiered health checks (Phase 1 additions)

2. **Worker Pool (riptide-workers)**
   - Worker lifecycle management
   - Load balancing algorithms
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Graceful shutdown scenarios

3. **Error Handling**
   - Network timeout scenarios
   - Malformed input handling
   - Resource exhaustion handling
   - Recovery mechanisms

4. **Concurrent Operations**
   - Race condition testing
   - Deadlock prevention
   - Thread safety verification
   - Async operation correctness

5. **Integration Tests**
   - End-to-end extraction flows
   - Multiple browser orchestration
   - API endpoint integration
   - Spider + Extraction integration

## Phase 1 Additions Needing Tests

### New BrowserPoolConfig Fields
All Phase 1 additions to BrowserPoolConfig need test coverage:

1. **Tiered Health Checks:**
   - `enable_tiered_health_checks`
   - `fast_check_interval`
   - `full_check_interval`
   - `error_check_delay`

2. **Memory Limits:**
   - `enable_memory_limits`
   - `memory_check_interval`
   - `memory_soft_limit_mb`
   - `memory_hard_limit_mb`
   - `enable_v8_heap_stats`

### Test Coverage Needed
- Fast health check functionality
- Full health check functionality
- Memory limit enforcement (soft/hard)
- Tiered monitoring intervals
- Performance improvement verification

## Coverage Measurement Plan

### Step 1: Install Coverage Tools ⏳
```bash
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin
# or
cargo install cargo-llvm-cov
```

**Status:** cargo-tarpaulin installation in progress

### Step 2: Fix Build Errors ❌
Must fix 3 build errors before coverage can be measured:
1. `riptide-cli/src/commands/extract_enhanced.rs:176`
2. `riptide-api/src/resource_manager/mod.rs:185`
3. `riptide-api/src/state.rs:775`

See `build-errors-baseline.md` for details.

### Step 3: Generate Baseline Coverage
```bash
# Full coverage report with HTML output
cargo tarpaulin --all --out Html --output-dir ./coverage/baseline

# Alternative with llvm-cov
cargo llvm-cov --all --html --output-dir ./coverage/baseline

# JSON output for CI/CD
cargo tarpaulin --all --out Json --output-dir ./coverage/baseline
```

### Step 4: Per-Crate Coverage
```bash
# Measure coverage for each crate individually
for crate in crates/*/; do
    cargo tarpaulin --manifest-path "$crate/Cargo.toml" --out Stdout
done
```

## Coverage Targets

### Phase 1 (Current Sprint)
- **Goal:** Establish baseline
- **Target:** No coverage decrease
- **Focus:** Ensure existing tests pass

### Phase 2 (Next Sprint)
- **Goal:** Improve coverage to >90%
- **Targets:**
  - Overall: >90%
  - Per-crate: >85%
  - Critical paths: >95%
  - Error paths: >80%

### Priority Areas for Coverage Improvement

**High Priority (Phase 2):**
1. riptide-headless browser pool (currently low)
2. riptide-workers pool management (currently low)
3. Error handling across all crates
4. Integration tests for end-to-end flows
5. Phase 1 feature verification tests

**Medium Priority:**
1. API endpoint edge cases
2. CLI command combinations
3. Configuration validation
4. Stealth feature scenarios

**Low Priority:**
1. Example code
2. Documentation tests
3. Benchmark code
4. Development utilities

## Coverage Quality Metrics

Beyond line coverage percentage, we will track:

### Branch Coverage
- Ensure all code paths are tested
- Target: >80% branch coverage

### Path Coverage
- Test important execution paths
- Focus on critical business logic

### Mutation Coverage (Future)
- Use cargo-mutants to verify test quality
- Target: >80% mutation score

## Tools and Configuration

### Coverage Tools
- **Primary:** cargo-tarpaulin (installing)
- **Alternative:** cargo-llvm-cov
- **CI/CD:** Generate HTML + JSON reports

### Configuration
```toml
# Cargo.toml additions for coverage
[dev-dependencies]
# Coverage tools run as separate commands
```

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/coverage.yml
- name: Generate coverage
  run: cargo tarpaulin --all --out Xml
- name: Upload to codecov
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

## Reporting Format

### HTML Report
- Visual coverage report
- Line-by-line coverage
- Branch coverage visualization
- Available at `coverage/baseline/index.html`

### JSON Report
- Machine-readable format
- For CI/CD integration
- Trend analysis
- Available at `coverage/baseline/tarpaulin-report.json`

### Summary Report
```
Coverage Summary:
  Total Lines: XXXX
  Covered: XXXX (XX.X%)
  Uncovered: XXXX

By Crate:
  riptide-core: XX.X%
  riptide-api: XX.X%
  riptide-extraction: XX.X%
  ...
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Unblock Coverage Measurement)
1. ✅ Install cargo-tarpaulin (in progress)
2. ❌ Fix 3 build errors (BLOCKING)
3. ⏳ Run coverage baseline
4. ⏳ Generate HTML report
5. ⏳ Document results

### Short-term (This Week)
1. Identify specific coverage gaps per crate
2. Create issues for low-coverage areas
3. Set up coverage CI/CD
4. Establish coverage trend tracking

### Phase 2 (Next Sprint)
1. Write tests for identified gaps
2. Improve coverage to >90%
3. Add integration tests
4. Test Phase 1 features thoroughly
5. Set up coverage regression prevention

## Known Limitations

### Blockers
- **Build Errors:** Cannot measure coverage until build succeeds
- **Async Code:** Some async code harder to measure
- **Browser Tests:** Headless browser tests may need special handling

### Measurement Challenges
- External dependencies (mocked in tests)
- Network operations (requires test fixtures)
- Browser automation (requires test infrastructure)
- Concurrent operations (requires specific test patterns)

## Success Criteria

### Baseline Establishment Complete When:
- ✅ Coverage tools installed
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ Coverage baseline measured
- ✅ HTML report generated
- ✅ Per-crate breakdown documented
- ✅ Coverage gaps identified
- ✅ Phase 2 targets set

### Phase 2 Complete When:
- ✅ Overall coverage >90%
- ✅ Per-crate coverage >85%
- ✅ All identified gaps addressed
- ✅ Phase 1 features tested
- ✅ Integration tests added
- ✅ CI/CD coverage checks enabled

**Status:** Waiting for build fixes to proceed with coverage measurement.
**Updated:** This document will be regenerated with actual metrics once coverage can be measured.
