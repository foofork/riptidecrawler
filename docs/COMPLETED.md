## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Core Foundation - 100% COMPLETE

### 1.1 WASM Integration
- **Pin trek-rs dependency and target**
  - Pinned to `trek-rs = "=0.2.1"` (confirmed available on crates.io)
  - Pinned to `wasm32-wasip2` Component Model (Tier-2 support via rustup)
  - Removed any `wasm32-wasip1` references

- **Implement Component Model (no WASI I/O)**
  - Added `wit/extractor.wit` with typed `extract(html, url, mode) -> ExtractedContent` function
  - Implemented guest with `wit-bindgen` (no `_start` entrypoint)
  - Host: use `wasmtime::component::bindgen!` and call typed `extract()` function
  - Removed stdin/stdout piping and WASI command interface

- **WASM-Core integration**
  - Replaced extract.rs WASI command code with Component Model calls
  - Handled WASM errors and fallbacks gracefully with structured error types
  - Enhanced instance management with resource cleanup and performance monitoring

### 1.2 API Implementation
- **Complete API handlers**
  - Implemented `/healthz` endpoint with comprehensive dependency checks
  - Completed `/crawl` batch processing logic with concurrent execution
  - Implemented `/deepsearch` with Serper.dev integration
  - Added proper error handling and HTTP status codes (400, 401, 404, 408, 429, 500, 502, 503)

- **Core business logic**
  - Implemented gate.rs decision algorithm with content quality scoring
  - Connected fetch ‚Üí gate ‚Üí extract ‚Üí render pipeline orchestration
  - Added caching layer with Redis integration and cache-first strategy
  - Wired all components together with state management and validation

### 1.3 Essential Testing
- **Golden test suite**
  - Used offline fixtures in CI to avoid flaky tests
  - Created expected output JSONs for multiple content types (articles, SPAs, news)
  - Implemented golden test runner for regression detection in `/tests/golden/`
  - Included property-based testing for edge case coverage

- **Integration tests**
  - Created working e2e test suite in `tests/integration/`
  - Tested full pipeline with offline fixtures and mocked services
  - Added comprehensive error scenario testing
  - Performance benchmarks and stress testing with 200+ concurrent requests

## ‚úÖ Phase 2 Lite: Minimal Reliability Foundation - 100% COMPLETE

### 2.1 Metrics & Health
- **Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint**
  - Added `axum-prometheus` middleware to API + headless
  - Request counters, duration histograms (p50/p95)
  - Export bucket config for performance monitoring

- **Enhanced `/healthz` endpoint**
  - Report `git_sha`, `wit=riptide:extractor@version`, `trek=version`
  - Component status checks (Redis, WASM, headless)
  - Build metadata and dependency versions

- **Phase timing logs**
  - Log phase timings: `fetch_ms`, `gate_ms`, `wasm_ms`, `render_ms`
  - Structured logging for performance analysis

### 2.2 Timeouts & Circuit Breakers
- **Fetch reliability**
  - Connect timeout: 3s, total timeout: 15-20s
  - 1 retry for idempotent requests only
  - Proper error propagation and fallback

- **Headless resilience**
  - `DOMContentLoaded + 1s idle`, hard cap 3s
  - Circuit breaker on consecutive headless failures
  - Graceful degradation to fast path when headless fails

### 2.3 Robots & Throttling
- **Robots.txt compliance**
  - Parse `robots.txt` using `robotstxt` crate
  - Toggle to bypass in development mode
  - Per-host robots.txt cache with TTL

- **Per-host throttling**
  - Token bucket per host (1-2 RPS default)
  - Configurable delay/throttling based on robot rules
  - Jitter (¬±20%) to avoid request pattern detection

### 2.4 Cache & Input Hardening
- **Redis read-through + TTL**
  - Cache key includes extractor version/options
  - TTL 24h default, configurable per content type
  - Respect `ETag`/`Last-Modified` with conditional GET

- **Input validation**
  - URL validation and content-type allowlist
  - Max bytes limit (20MB default)
  - CORS and header size limits
  - XSS/injection protection

### PR-1: Headless RPC v2 - Dynamic Content
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Branch**: `feature/phase3-pr1-headless-v2`

- **Enhanced RenderRequest model** with session_id, actions, timeouts, artifacts
- **Page action implementations**:
  - WaitForCss with configurable timeout
  - WaitForJs with expression evaluation
  - Scroll with steps, pixels, and delay
  - JavaScript code execution
  - Click actions on CSS selectors
  - Type actions with optional delay
- **Action executor implementation** with full error handling
