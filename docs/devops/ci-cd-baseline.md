# CI/CD Baseline Report - 2025-10-17

## Executive Summary

**Platform:** GitHub Actions
**Status:** Optimized multi-stage pipeline with parallel execution
**Critical Issue:** Build currently failing due to compilation errors in `riptide-cli` and `riptide-api`

## Current Setup Overview

### Active Workflows

1. **Main CI Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
   - Optimized with concurrency cancellation
   - Parallel build matrix (native + WASM)
   - Parallel testing (unit + integration)
   - Quality checks, benchmarks, validation

2. **API Validation Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/api-validation.yml`)
   - Fast-track API-specific validation (5-8 min feedback)
   - Contract testing with Dredd
   - Fuzzing with Schemathesis
   - Performance testing with k6
   - Security scanning with OWASP ZAP

3. **Safety Audit** (`.github/workflows/safety-audit.yml`)
   - Unsafe code auditing
   - Clippy production checks (no unwrap/expect)
   - Miri memory safety validation
   - WASM safety documentation

4. **Refactoring Quality** (`.github/workflows/refactoring-quality.yml`)
   - Code quality gates
   - File length validation (<600 LOC)
   - Coverage tracking
   - Multi-platform builds

5. **Docker Build** (`.github/workflows/docker-build.yml`)
   - Separated from main CI for performance

## Pipeline Performance Analysis

### Main CI Pipeline Stages

| Stage | Timeout | Strategy | Status |
|-------|---------|----------|--------|
| **Quick Checks** | 10 min | Sequential | ✅ Fast preliminary validation |
| **Build (native)** | 30 min | Parallel matrix | ⚠️ Currently failing |
| **Build (WASM)** | 30 min | Parallel matrix | ⚠️ Build dependency |
| **Test (unit)** | 15 min | Parallel | ⚠️ Blocked by build failure |
| **Test (integration)** | 15 min | Parallel | ⚠️ Blocked by build failure |
| **Size Check** | 5 min | Dependent | ⚠️ Blocked |
| **Quality & Security** | 20 min | Parallel (continue-on-error) | 🔶 Advisory |
| **Benchmarks** | 15 min | Main branch only | 🔶 Optional |
| **Final Validation** | 5 min | Sequential | ⚠️ Blocked |

### Estimated Timing (When Working)

**Optimized parallel execution:**
- **Fast path:** 10 min (checks only)
- **Standard build:** 30-35 min (check + build + test in parallel)
- **Full pipeline:** 40-50 min (all stages including quality)

**Sequential equivalent:** ~80-100 min (2x slower)

### Performance Optimizations Already In Place

✅ **Concurrency Management**
- Cancel in-progress runs on new push
- Reduces wasted CI resources

✅ **Smart Path Filtering**
- Docs/markdown changes skip CI
- Docker builds separated
- API-specific changes use fast-track validation

✅ **Caching Strategy**
- Swatinem/rust-cache for Cargo dependencies
- Shared cache keys across jobs
- WASM artifact caching

✅ **Parallel Execution**
- Build matrix (native + WASM)
- Test matrix (unit + integration)
- Quality checks run in parallel

✅ **Incremental Builds**
- CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 for CI reproducibility
- Cargo cache restoration

## Current Bottlenecks

### Critical Issues

1. **Build Failures** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - `riptide-cli`: Missing field in struct initialization
   - `riptide-api`: Compilation errors blocking entire pipeline
   - **Impact:** Pipeline cannot complete, no artifacts produced

2. **Build Time** (MEDIUM)
   - 30-minute timeout for build jobs
   - Native build includes heavy dependencies (chromium, wasmtime, PDF processing)
   - Estimated actual build time: 15-25 minutes when working

3. **Test Time** (LOW-MEDIUM)
   - Unit tests: ~5-8 minutes (test-threads=4)
   - Integration tests: ~8-12 minutes (test-threads=2)
   - Could benefit from better parallelization

### Optimization Opportunities

1. **Cache Warming**
   - Pre-build dependency cache for faster cold starts
   - Current cache hit rate: Unknown (needs metrics)

2. **Test Parallelization**
   - Increase test-threads for unit tests (currently 4, could go to 8-12)
   - Better test splitting for integration tests

3. **Build Artifacts Reuse**
   - Build once, test multiple times
   - Current: Tests rebuild independently

4. **Quality Checks**
   - Some checks run serially (could be parallel)
   - cargo-audit, cargo-deny, bloat analysis can run concurrently

## Resource Usage

### Build Resources
- **Runner:** ubuntu-latest (4 cores, 16GB RAM)
- **Build parallelism:** 4 jobs (CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=4)
- **Disk usage:** Unknown (needs monitoring)

### System Dependencies
```bash
libfontconfig1-dev
pkg-config
chromium-browser
chromium-chromedriver
```

### Cargo Tool Installation
- cargo-deny
- cargo-audit
- cargo-bloat
- cargo-llvm-cov
- cargo-tarpaulin

## API Validation Performance

**Fast-track validation:** 5-8 minutes vs 30 minutes for full CI

### Stages
1. Static Analysis: 2-3 min
2. Contract Testing: 5-7 min
3. Fuzzing: 5-8 min
4. Performance Tests: 8-12 min (main branch only)
5. Security Scan: 20-25 min (parallel with performance)

## Recommendations for Phase 2

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)

1. **Fix Build Failures**
   - Address compilation errors in `riptide-cli` and `riptide-api`
   - **Impact:** Unblocks entire pipeline

2. **Establish Metrics Collection**
   - Track build times per job
   - Monitor cache hit rates
   - Record test execution times

3. **Document Current Performance**
   - Baseline timing for each stage
   - Resource utilization patterns

### Phase 2 Optimizations (Week 2-3)

1. **Build Optimization (Target: -10-15%)**
   - Increase CARGO_BUILD_JOBS to 6-8
   - Optimize dependency tree
   - Consider sccache for distributed caching

2. **Test Optimization (Target: -30-40%)**
   - Increase test parallelism (threads: 8-12 for unit tests)
   - Split large integration test suites
   - Implement test result caching

3. **Pipeline Restructuring**
   - Build once, reuse artifacts for tests
   - Parallel quality checks
   - Conditional benchmark runs

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Self-hosted Runners**
   - More cores for parallel compilation
   - Local cache persistence
   - Estimated speedup: 20-30%

2. **Incremental Testing**
   - Run only affected tests
   - File-based test selection
   - Estimated speedup: 40-50% for small changes

3. **Advanced Caching**
   - Build artifact caching across branches
   - Test result caching
   - Docker layer caching

## Code Statistics

- **Total Rust files:** 521 in crates/ + 15 in wasm/
- **Total crate size:** 9.2MB
- **Active workflows:** 5
- **Parallel jobs:** Up to 6 concurrent

## Security & Safety

### Safety Audits
- Unsafe code documentation required
- No unwrap/expect in production code
- Miri memory safety checks
- WASM FFI safety documentation

### Security Scanning
- cargo-audit for dependency vulnerabilities
- OWASP ZAP for API security
- Clippy security lints

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Document baseline (this report)
2. ⏭️ Set up metrics collection pipeline
3. ⏭️ Create performance monitoring scripts
4. ⏭️ Implement health monitoring
5. ⏭️ Develop deployment automation
6. ⏭️ Create operations runbook
7. ⏭️ Coordinate with development team on build fixes
