## Technical Analysis

### Current CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

#### Workflows Overview

1. **Main CI Pipeline** (`ci.yml`)
   - Parallel build matrix (native + WASM)
   - Parallel test matrix (unit + integration)
   - Binary size monitoring
   - Quality & security checks
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Final validation

2. **API Validation** (`api-validation.yml`)
   - Fast-track validation (5-8 min)
   - Contract testing (Dredd)
   - API fuzzing (Schemathesis)
   - Load testing (k6)
   - Security scanning (OWASP ZAP)

3. **Safety Audit** (`safety-audit.yml`)
   - Unsafe code auditing
   - Clippy production checks
   - Miri memory safety
   - WASM safety documentation

4. **Refactoring Quality** (`refactoring-quality.yml`)
   - Code quality gates
   - File length validation
   - Coverage tracking
   - Multi-platform builds

5. **Docker Build** (`docker-build.yml`)
   - Separated for performance

#### Performance Optimizations Already in Place

✅ Concurrency cancellation
✅ Smart path filtering
✅ Cargo dependency caching
✅ Parallel execution
✅ Incremental build settings
✅ WASM artifact caching

### Critical Issues Identified

#### 1. Build Failures (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Impact:** Entire pipeline blocked

**Errors:**
- `riptide-cli`: Missing struct field in initialization
- `riptide-api`: Compilation errors

**Required Action:**
- Development team must fix compilation errors
- DevOps cannot proceed with live baseline until fixed

**Mitigation:**
- All infrastructure prepared and ready
- Metrics collection automated
- Can establish baseline immediately upon fix

#### 2. Baseline Metrics Collection (BLOCKED)

**Status:** Infrastructure ready, awaiting working build

**Next Steps:**
1. Wait for build fix
2. Run full CI/CD pipeline
3. Collect 5-10 build samples
4. Establish baseline metrics
5. Update performance-baseline.md
