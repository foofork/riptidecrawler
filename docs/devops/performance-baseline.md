## Optimization Strategies

### Phase 2 Week 2: Build Optimization

1. **Increase Build Parallelism**
   ```yaml
   CARGO_BUILD_JOBS: 6-8  # from 4
   ```
   - Expected improvement: 10-15%
   - Risk: Higher memory usage

2. **Advanced Caching**
   - Implement sccache for distributed caching
   - Cache compiled dependencies across branches
   - Expected improvement: 15-20% on cache hit

3. **Dependency Optimization**
   - Review and trim unnecessary dependencies
   - Use feature flags to reduce compilation units
   - Expected improvement: 5-10%

### Phase 2 Week 3: Test Optimization

1. **Increased Test Parallelism**
   ```yaml
   --test-threads=8-12  # from 4 (unit tests)
   --test-threads=4     # from 2 (integration tests)
   ```
   - Expected improvement: 30-40%
   - Risk: Resource contention

2. **Test Splitting**
   - Split large integration test suites
   - Run critical tests first
   - Expected improvement: 20-30%

3. **Test Result Caching**
   - Cache test results for unchanged files
   - Skip tests for unchanged modules
   - Expected improvement: 40-50% on incremental changes

### Phase 2 Week 4: Pipeline Optimization

1. **Artifact Reuse**
   - Build once, test multiple times
   - Share artifacts between jobs
   - Expected improvement: 15-20%

2. **Parallel Quality Checks**
   - Run all quality checks in parallel
   - Use dedicated jobs for each check
   - Expected improvement: 10-15%

3. **Conditional Execution**
   - Path-based job triggering
   - Skip unnecessary steps
   - Expected improvement: 25-35% on small changes

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Build Time Metrics**
   - Total build duration
   - Per-crate build time
   - WASM compilation time
   - Cache hit/miss rate

   - Test success rate
   - Test coverage percentage
   - Flaky test detection

3. **Resource Metrics**

## Baseline Establishment Process

### Step 1: Fix Build Errors ⚠️ CRITICAL

- Address compilation errors in `riptide-api`
- Verify all crates build successfully

### Step 2: Measure Current Performance
1. Run full CI/CD pipeline
2. Collect metrics via workflow
3. Generate baseline report
4. Document results here

### Step 3: Establish Benchmarks
1. Run 5-10 builds to get averages
2. Measure cache hit rates
3. Profile resource usage
4. Identify bottlenecks

### Step 4: Set Improvement Targets
1. Calculate realistic improvement goals
2. Prioritize optimization areas
3. Create detailed optimization plan
4. Schedule implementation

## Performance Tracking

- Optimization progress
- Bottleneck analysis
- Recommendations

### Phase Milestones
- **Week 1:** Baseline established ⏭️

- **Week 5:** Final validation and tuning

## Known Bottlenecks (Preliminary)

### Identified Issues

1. **Heavy Dependencies**
   - Chromium browser installation
   - PDF processing libraries (pdfium)
   - WASM toolchain
   - Impact: Adds 5-10 minutes to build

2. **Serial Test Execution**
   - Integration tests run on 2 threads
   - Some tests cannot run in parallel
   - Impact: 8-12 minutes for integration tests

3. **Cold Cache Builds**
   - First build on PR can be slow
   - Cache not shared across forks
   - Impact: 20-30 minute first build

4. **Quality Check Tools**
   - Multiple tool installations (cargo-audit, cargo-deny, etc.)
   - Some checks run sequentially
   - Impact: 10-15 minutes

## Success Criteria

### Phase 2 Goals

✅ **Build Time:** Reduce by 10-15%
✅ **Test Time:** Reduce by 30-40%
✅ **Total CI/CD:** Reduce by 30%
✅ **Cache Hit Rate:** Achieve >80%
✅ **Resource Efficiency:** Improve by 25%
✅ **Monitoring:** Full metrics collection operational
✅ **Documentation:** Complete baseline and optimization guide

### Validation

- All optimizations validated with A/B testing
- No regression in test coverage
- No increase in build failures
- Improved developer feedback time
