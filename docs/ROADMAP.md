## 5) Phase 0 — Technical Debt & Integration (all original items retained)

### 0.1 Core Integration Gaps — **CRITICAL / \~1 week**

* WASM extractor wiring (see §1.1), dynamic rendering implementation (see §1.1).

### 0.2 Error Handling Improvements — **✅ COMPLETED**

* ✅ Progress: 336 unwrap/expect calls fixed (259 remaining, mostly in tests)
* ✅ Production code: Only 15 unwrap/expect remaining (down from 204)
* ✅ All critical paths (render, streaming, resource_manager) now panic-free
* **Current Status:** 94.3% complete - production code secured
* **Impact:** Production stability dramatically improved; critical panic points eliminated.

### 0.3 Monitoring & Observability — **HIGH / 1 week**

* (Minimal Prometheus already in §1.3.)
* Add: system metrics placeholders at `health.rs:358-366` → real CPU/mem/fd/disk; RPS/latency dashboards; perf benchmarking suite.
* **Acceptance:** SLA panels; benchmark scripts checked in.

### 0.4 Session & Worker Management — **HIGH / 3–4 days**

* Sessions & cookies (see §1.4).
* Worker service (`riptide-workers/main.rs:13`): batch queue, job scheduling, retries, pool mgmt.
* **Acceptance:** background job runs batch crawl; retries on transient errors.

### 0.5 Resource Management & Performance — **MED / 3–4 days**

* Browser pooling/memory optimization; cleanup on timeouts; WASM lifecycle monitoring; memory alerts.
* Build pipeline optimization (address WASM 5+ min timeouts; dependency caching; incremental; parallel).
* **Acceptance:** stable memory; improved build times.

### 0.6 Test Coverage & Quality — **MED / 3–5 days**

* Raise to **≥80%** (currently **75%**); cover refactored modules & new features; golden tests for new outputs.
* **Tool Migration:** Use `cargo llvm-cov --html` instead of tarpaulin for better performance and accuracy.
* **Command:** `cargo llvm-cov --html --open` to generate and view coverage report.

### 0.7 Circuit Breaker Enhancements — **LOW / 2 days**

* Adaptive thresholds; performance-based tuning; self-learning failure patterns.
* **Acceptance:** breaker avoids flapping; steady success rate under partial headless failures.

## 14) Immediate Next Steps (exact order)

**🔴 CURRENT PRIORITIES (September 24, 2025)**

**Code Quality Issues Discovered (NEW):**
1. 🐛 **Compilation Errors** - Several test files have compilation errors (spider/tests.rs, strategies benchmarks)
2. 🧹 **Dead Code** - 45+ functions/structs marked with #[allow(dead_code)] need removal
3. 📦 **Unused Imports** - 78+ unused imports across multiple files need cleanup
4. 🔄 **Duplicate Code** - 47 distinct patterns of code duplication identified
5. ⚠️ **Technical Debt** - Estimated 15-20 hours to address all issues

**High Priority Implementation Tasks:**
1. 📊 **PDF Progress Tracking** - Wire up existing progress callback infrastructure
   - Already implemented but not connected to production pipeline
   - Needed for: Large PDFs (100+ MB), Worker service integration, Streaming updates
   - Implementation: Modify PdfPipeline to accept callbacks, add to worker service
   - Benefits: Real-time progress for long operations, better UX, monitoring metrics

**Remaining Work:**
1. 🔧 **PDF Pipeline Optimization (PR-4)** - Complete final 15% (memory management)
2. **PDF Progress Integration** - Connect progress callbacks to production (2-3 hours)
3. **Build/CI Speed Optimization** - Cache WASM artifacts, incremental builds
4. **Integration Reconciliation** - Final cross-component wiring audit (see §15)
5. **Code Quality Cleanup** - Remove dead code, fix unused imports, refactor duplicates

**Major Milestones Recently Completed** → See COMPLETED.md for full details

**Week 6 - INTEGRATION RECONCILIATION (Critical Step)**

18\) **Cross-Component Wiring Audit**
    * Verify all imports are properly connected between modules
    * Ensure session cookies flow through browser pool → render handlers

    * Wire error types consistently across boundaries
    * Verify WASM extractor receives data from all sources

19\) **Dependency Graph Validation**
    * Map all inter-component dependencies
    * Identify missing connections (e.g., PDF processor → metrics)
    * Ensure streaming pipeline receives from all producers
    * Verify cleanup handlers triggered from all failure paths

20\) **Integration Touch-ups**
    * Add missing trait implementations (From, Into, Error conversions)
    * Wire up orphaned event handlers and callbacks
    * Connect rate limiter to ALL HTTP operations (not just render)
    * Ensure memory manager tracks ALL allocations
    * Complete bidirectional connections (request → response paths)

21\) **End-to-End Flow Verification**
    * Trace a request through entire pipeline
    * Verify all telemetry/metrics collected
    * Ensure all resources properly released
    * Check all error paths return appropriate responses

**Parallel (Weeks 0–6)**

* Build/CI speedups, test coverage to ≥80%, circuit breaker tuning (low priority).

## 15) Integration Reconciliation Phase (New Section)

### What This Phase Addresses:
When we build components in isolation, we often miss:
- **Forgotten Imports**: Components that should use shared types/traits but don't
- **Partial Wirings**: A→B connected but B→C forgotten
- **Orphaned Features**: Implemented but never called from anywhere
- **Inconsistent Patterns**: Different error handling/logging/metrics across modules
- **Missing Backpressure**: Component A floods B without flow control
- **Dangling Resources**: Cleanup in error paths not wired to all callers

### Key Reconciliation Tasks:
1. **Import Audit**: Ensure all shared types (SessionId, RequestId, etc.) used consistently
2. **Metrics Wiring**: Every operation reports to performance monitor
3. **Error Propagation**: All errors properly converted and bubbled up
4. **Resource Lifecycle**: All guards/locks/handles properly released
5. **Event Flow**: All events have publishers AND subscribers
6. **Configuration Propagation**: Settings reach all relevant components
7. **Telemetry Coverage**: No blind spots in observability

### Success Criteria:
- No unused imports remain
- No unreachable code warnings
- All pub methods have at least one caller
- Resource leak detection shows clean
- Integration tests pass with all components active
- Metrics dashboard shows data from ALL components

### Integration Checklist (Run After Each Component):
```
□ Does this component import all relevant shared types?
□ Does it emit metrics to the performance monitor?
□ Are errors properly wrapped with context?
□ Do cleanup paths trigger in ALL failure scenarios?
□ Are resources (browsers, memory, handles) released?
□ Is backpressure/rate limiting applied?
□ Do callbacks/event handlers have subscribers?
□ Is configuration read from the global config?
□ Are there integration tests with real dependencies?
□ Does telemetry show this component's activity?
```

### Common Integration Misses (Watch For These):
- **Browser Pool** → Need to wire checkout/checkin to ALL render paths
- **Session Manager** → Must flow through middleware to handlers to browser
- **Rate Limiter** → Often forgotten on secondary HTTP paths (health, metrics)
- **Memory Manager** → PDF/WASM/Spider allocations often not tracked
- **Performance Monitor** → Checkpoints missing in async continuation points
- **Error Context** → Lost when crossing async boundaries
- **Streaming Pipeline** → Backpressure not propagated to producers
- **Resource Guards** → Drop implementations not triggering cleanup
