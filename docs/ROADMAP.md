## 🚀 Active Work (Priority Order)

### 1. WASM Enhancement Sprint — **🔴 HIGH PRIORITY** (1-3 days)
**See detailed analysis:** [`docs/WASM_ANALYSIS.md`](./WASM_ANALYSIS.md)

**Day 1-2: Complete WASM Feature Surface**
1. ⚡ **Extract Missing Fields** - Implement links[], media[], language, categories extraction
2. 📊 **Fix Memory Tracking** - Replace placeholder with host-side ResourceLimiter
3. 🚀 **Enable SIMD** - Add +simd128 for 10-25% performance boost
4. 💾 **AOT Cache** - Enable wasmtime cache for faster startup (50ms → 5ms)

**Day 2-3: Production Hardening**
5. 🔄 **Instance Pooling** - Proper Store-per-call with semaphore concurrency
6. 🛡️ **Add Fallback** - Native readability-rs fallback + WASM circuit breaker
7. 🧪 **Golden Tests** - Add fixtures and deterministic snapshots

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WASM returns complete extraction data (links with rel attributes, media URLs, language detection)
- Memory metrics exposed at `/metrics` endpoint
- 10-25% CPU reduction on text-heavy pages
- Cold start <15ms after first run
- Circuit breaker trips on >X% failure rate
- fully tested zero errors

### 2. PDF Pipeline Completion (PR-4) — **✅ COMPLETE** (100%)

**Completed Tasks:**
* ✅ **Module Structure:** Complete PDF module with processor, config, types, and utils
* ✅ **Detection:** PDF detection by content-type, extension, and magic bytes
* ✅ **Processing:** PDF processor with pdfium integration and fallback
* ✅ **Integration:** Pipeline integration and processing result types
* ✅ **Concurrency Controls:** Semaphore-limited to 2 concurrent operations
* ✅ **Memory Management:** Stable memory usage with proper cleanup
* ✅ **Benchmarks:** Performance benchmarks operational
* ✅ **Metrics Integration:** PDF metrics connected to monitoring system
* ✅ **Error Propagation:** Proper error handling through pipeline

**Status:** ✅ 100% complete - fully integrated and tested
**Result:** PDFs yield text + metadata; images extracted for illustrated docs; stable memory.

### 3. PDF Progress Tracking Integration — **✅ COMPLETE**

**Completed Implementation:**
* ✅ Progress callback infrastructure connected to production pipeline
* ✅ Worker service integration with PdfProcessor
* ✅ Streaming endpoints for real-time progress updates (/pdf/process-stream)
* ✅ Support for large PDFs (100+ MB) with memory monitoring
* ✅ Progress overhead tracking in microseconds
* ✅ Comprehensive test suite with 8+ integration tests
* ✅ Validation scripts for CI/CD integration

**Validation Status:** 12/13 checks passing (only minor unwrap() cleanup needed in utils)

### 4. Build/CI Speed Optimization — **🔵 P2** (1 day)

* Cache WASM component artifact; incremental builds; parallel CI; binary size lint.
* **Acceptance:** CI time reduced; artifacts uploaded per PR; **3.9GB** build space reclaimed retained.

### 5. Code Quality Cleanup — **✅ COMPLETE**

**Resolved Issues (2025-09-25):**
1. ✅ **Compilation Errors** - RESOLVED: All modules compile successfully
2. ✅ **Refactoring Integration** - COMPLETED: 400+ lines of duplicate code eliminated
3. ✅ **Rust 2024 Compatibility** - FIXED: All never-type issues resolved
4. ✅ **Clippy Errors** - FIXED: All critical clippy errors resolved
5. ✅ **Dead Code** - ADDRESSED: Added proper attributes for test utilities
6. ✅ **Import Cleanup** - COMPLETED: All unused imports removed

**Fixed Clippy Issues:**
- ✅ Removed all unused imports across riptide-api handlers
- ✅ Fixed wrong-self-convention (renamed from_env* to load_from_env*)
- ✅ Replaced assertions-on-constants with TODO comments
- ✅ Removed needless borrows
- ✅ Simplified match-single-binding patterns
- ✅ Fixed let-unit-value warnings
- ✅ Boxed large enum variants to reduce stack usage
- ✅ Used derive(Default) instead of manual implementations
- ✅ Fixed field-reassign-with-default patterns
- ✅ Replaced manual Option::map implementations
- ✅ Converted single-arm matches to if statements

**Current State:**
- Project compiles with `cargo check` ✅
- No critical clippy errors (without -D warnings) ✅
- 218 warnings remain (mostly in test/example code, non-blocking)

## 📊 Current Performance Metrics

### Test Coverage Enhancement
* **Current:** 75%
* **Target:** ≥80%
* **Tool Migration:** Use `cargo llvm-cov --html` instead of tarpaulin for better performance and accuracy
* **Command:** `cargo llvm-cov --html --open` to generate and view coverage report

### Error Handling Status
* ✅ **Progress:** 336 unwrap/expect calls fixed (259 remaining, mostly in tests)
* ✅ **Production code:** Only 15 unwrap/expect remaining (down from 204)
* ✅ **All critical paths:** render, streaming, resource_manager now panic-free
* **Current Status:** 94.3% complete - production code secured

## 🔄 Integration Reconciliation Phase

### What This Addresses:
When building components in isolation, we often miss:
- **Forgotten Imports**: Components that should use shared types/traits but don't
- **Partial Wirings**: A→B connected but B→C forgotten
- **Orphaned Features**: Implemented but never called from anywhere
- **Inconsistent Patterns**: Different error handling/logging/metrics across modules

### Key Reconciliation Tasks:
1. **Import Audit**: Ensure all shared types (SessionId, RequestId, etc.) used consistently
2. **Metrics Wiring**: Every operation reports to performance monitor
3. **Error Propagation**: All errors properly converted and bubbled up
4. **Resource Lifecycle**: All guards/locks/handles properly released
5. **Event Flow**: All events have publishers AND subscribers
6. **Configuration Propagation**: Settings reach all relevant components
7. **Telemetry Coverage**: No blind spots in observability

### Integration Checklist (Run After Each Component):
```
□ Does this component import all relevant shared types?
□ Does it emit metrics to the performance monitor?
□ Are errors properly wrapped with context?
□ Do cleanup paths trigger in ALL failure scenarios?
□ Are resources (browsers, memory, handles) released?
□ Is backpressure/rate limiting applied?
□ Do callbacks/event handlers have subscribers?
□ Is configuration read from the global config?
□ Are there integration tests with real dependencies?
□ Does telemetry show this component's activity?
```

## 🎯 Performance Targets (Unchanged)

* **Fast-path:** p50 ≤ **1.5s**, p95 ≤ **5s** (10-URL mixed).
* **Streaming:** TTFB < **500ms** (warm cache).
* **Headless ratio:** < **15%**.
* **PDF:** ≤ **2** concurrent; no > **200MB** RSS spikes per worker.
* **Cache:** Wasmtime instance reuse; Redis read-through (24h TTL; keys include extractor version + strategy + chunking).
* **Gate:** thresholds hi=**0.55** / lo=**0.35**.
