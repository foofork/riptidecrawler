## 15) Integration Reconciliation Phase (New Section)

### What This Phase Addresses:
When we build components in isolation, we often miss:
- **Forgotten Imports**: Components that should use shared types/traits but don't
- **Partial Wirings**: Aâ†’B connected but Bâ†’C forgotten
- **Orphaned Features**: Implemented but never called from anywhere
- **Inconsistent Patterns**: Different error handling/logging/metrics across modules
- **Missing Backpressure**: Component A floods B without flow control
- **Dangling Resources**: Cleanup in error paths not wired to all callers

### Key Reconciliation Tasks:
1. **Import Audit**: Ensure all shared types (SessionId, RequestId, etc.) used consistently
2. **Metrics Wiring**: Every operation reports to performance monitor
3. **Error Propagation**: All errors properly converted and bubbled up
4. **Resource Lifecycle**: All guards/locks/handles properly released
5. **Event Flow**: All events have publishers AND subscribers
6. **Configuration Propagation**: Settings reach all relevant components
7. **Telemetry Coverage**: No blind spots in observability

### Success Criteria:
- No unused imports remain
- No unreachable code warnings
- All pub methods have at least one caller
- Resource leak detection shows clean
- Integration tests pass with all components active
- Metrics dashboard shows data from ALL components

### Integration Checklist (Run After Each Component):
```
â–¡ Does this component import all relevant shared types?
â–¡ Does it emit metrics to the performance monitor?
â–¡ Are errors properly wrapped with context?
â–¡ Do cleanup paths trigger in ALL failure scenarios?
â–¡ Are resources (browsers, memory, handles) released?
â–¡ Is backpressure/rate limiting applied?
â–¡ Do callbacks/event handlers have subscribers?
â–¡ Is configuration read from the global config?
â–¡ Are there integration tests with real dependencies?
â–¡ Does telemetry show this component's activity?
```

### Common Integration Misses (Watch For These):
- **Browser Pool** â†’ Need to wire checkout/checkin to ALL render paths
- **Session Manager** â†’ Must flow through middleware to handlers to browser
- **Rate Limiter** â†’ Often forgotten on secondary HTTP paths (health, metrics)
- **Memory Manager** â†’ PDF/WASM/Spider allocations often not tracked
- **Performance Monitor** â†’ Checkpoints missing in async continuation points
- **Error Context** â†’ Lost when crossing async boundaries
- **Streaming Pipeline** â†’ Backpressure not propagated to producers
- **Resource Guards** â†’ Drop implementations not triggering cleanup
