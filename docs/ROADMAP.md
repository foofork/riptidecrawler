---

## 🎯 PHASE 1: Core Foundation (2-3 weeks)
*Priority: CRITICAL - Required for MVP*

### 1.1 WASM Integration - CRITICAL BLOCKER
**Issues**: Trek-rs dependency version mismatch, placeholder WASM implementation

- [x] **Pin trek-rs dependency and target** ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ Pin to `trek-rs = "=0.2.1"` (confirmed available on crates.io)
  - ✅ Pin to `wasm32-wasip2` Component Model (Tier-2 support via rustup)
  - ✅ Remove any `wasm32-wasip1` references

- [x] **Implement Component Model (no WASI I/O)** ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ Add `wit/extractor.wit` with typed `extract(html, url, mode) -> ExtractedContent` function
  - ✅ Implement guest with `wit-bindgen` (no `_start` entrypoint)
  - ✅ Host: use `wasmtime::component::bindgen!` and call typed `extract()` function
  - ✅ Remove stdin/stdout piping and WASI command interface

- [x] **WASM-Core integration** ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ Replace extract.rs WASI command code with Component Model calls
  - ✅ Handle WASM errors and fallbacks gracefully with structured error types
  - ✅ Enhanced instance management with resource cleanup and performance monitoring

### 1.2 API Implementation - HIGH PRIORITY
**Issues**: Missing handler implementations, no health endpoints

- [x] **Complete API handlers** ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ Implement `/healthz` endpoint with comprehensive dependency checks
  - ✅ Complete `/crawl` batch processing logic with concurrent execution
  - ✅ Implement `/deepsearch` with Serper.dev integration
  - ✅ Add proper error handling and HTTP status codes (400, 401, 404, 408, 429, 500, 502, 503)

- [x] **Core business logic** ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ Implement gate.rs decision algorithm with content quality scoring
  - ✅ Connect fetch → gate → extract → render pipeline orchestration
  - ✅ Add caching layer with Redis integration and cache-first strategy
  - ✅ Wire all components together with state management and validation

### 1.3 Essential Testing - HIGH PRIORITY
**Issues**: No working test suite, validation failures

- [x] **Golden test suite** ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ Use offline fixtures in CI to avoid flaky tests
  - ✅ Create expected output JSONs for multiple content types (articles, SPAs, news)
  - ✅ Implement golden test runner for regression detection in `/tests/golden/`
  - ✅ Include property-based testing for edge case coverage

- [x] **Integration tests** ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ Create working e2e test suite in `tests/integration/`
  - ✅ Test full pipeline with offline fixtures and mocked services
  - ✅ Add comprehensive error scenario testing
  - ✅ Performance benchmarks and stress testing with 200+ concurrent requests

## 🚀 PHASE 2 LITE: Minimal Reliability Foundation (2-4 days)
*Priority: HIGH - Essential scaffolding before Crawl4AI parity work*

**Goal**: Minimal production-readiness to enable safe Phase-3 development

### 2.1 Metrics & Health (1 day)
- [ ] **Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint**
  - Add `axum-prometheus` middleware to API + headless
  - Request counters, duration histograms (p50/p95)

- [ ] **Enhanced `/healthz` endpoint**
  - Report `git_sha`, `wit=riptide:extractor@version`, `trek=version`
  - Component status checks (Redis, WASM, headless)
  - Build metadata and dependency versions

- [ ] **Phase timing logs**
  - Log phase timings: `fetch_ms`, `gate_ms`, `wasm_ms`, `render_ms`
  - Structured logging for performance analysis

### 2.2 Timeouts & Circuit Breakers (1 day)
- [ ] **Fetch reliability**
  - Connect timeout: 3s, total timeout: 15-20s
  - 1 retry for idempotent requests only
  - Proper error propagation and fallback

- [ ] **Headless resilience**
  - `DOMContentLoaded + 1s idle`, hard cap 3s
  - Circuit breaker on consecutive headless failures
  - Graceful degradation to fast path when headless fails

### 2.3 Robots & Throttling (1 day)
- [ ] **Robots.txt compliance**
  - Parse `robots.txt` using `robotstxt` crate
  - Toggle to bypass in development mode
  - Per-host robots.txt cache with TTL

- [ ] **Per-host throttling**
  - Token bucket per host (1-2 RPS default)
  - Configurable delay/throttling based on robot rules
  - Jitter (±20%) to avoid request pattern detection

### 2.4 Cache & Input Hardening (1 day)
- [ ] **Redis read-through + TTL**

  - `actions` support: click, type, evaluate JS
  - Timeout handling and fallback to static

- [ ] **Artifacts & Capture**
  - Optional screenshot capture (PNG/WebP)
  - MHTML capture for complete page preservation
  - Page metadata collection (title, description, OG tags)

**Acceptance**: JS-heavy article (Next/React) → `wait_for` loads content → extracted text present → `scroll` loads lazy content → screenshot artifact saved when enabled

### 3.2 Deep Crawling & Site Discovery (Week 2)
- [ ] **Spider-rs integration**
  - Site-wide crawling with depth limits (max 3-5 levels)
  - Per-host budget controls (time, request limits)

  - Same-host filtering and URL normalization

- [ ] **Adaptive stopping**
  - Content quality scoring to stop early when goal met
  - Duplicate content detection to avoid redundant crawling
  - Link value scoring for priority queuing

**Acceptance**: Domain seed → crawler respects depth/budgets & robots → returns ≥N pages with per-page extraction + outlinks

### 3.3 Stealth & Anti-Detection (Week 3)
- [ ] **User-agent rotation**
  - Configurable UA list with realistic browser signatures
  - `--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled` for headless

- [ ] **Multi-format content handling**
  - Content-type detection and routing
  - Word/PowerPoint basic text extraction (if feasible)
  - Archive file handling (ZIP with HTML/PDF contents)

**Acceptance**: Known PDFs → extract returns text+metadata → image count > 0 for illustrated docs

### 3.5 Output Formats & Streaming (Week 5)
- [ ] **NDJSON streaming**
  - Streaming output for `/crawl` and `/deepsearch`
  - Real-time progress updates during batch processing
  - Configurable batch sizes and flush intervals

- [ ] **Content chunking**
  - Token-aware chunks with configurable size/overlap

  - Byline/date extraction from Open Graph and JSON-LD
  - Fallback heuristics for author and publication date
  - Mode switch: `article|generic|metadata` extraction
  - Consistent Markdown formatting across runs

**Acceptance**: Top-N URLs stream back record-by-record → chunks produced for long articles → links/media populated → byline/date captured in ≥80% where present

## 🚨 Critical Dependencies & Risks

### Technical Risks:
1. **WASM Component Model**: New technology stack with wasip2 target
2. **Performance at Scale**: Unknown bottlenecks in concurrent processing
3. **Headless Browser Stability**: Chrome crashes under heavy load

- **Memory**: Implement proper component instance pooling and cleanup

### External Dependencies:
- **Serper.dev API**: Rate limits and costs
- **Docker/Kubernetes**: Infrastructure stability
