- Advanced features and Crawl4AI parity

---

## 🎯 PHASE 1: Core Foundation (2-3 weeks)
*Priority: CRITICAL - Required for MVP*

### 1.1 WASM Integration - CRITICAL BLOCKER
**Issues**: Trek-rs dependency version mismatch, placeholder WASM implementation

- [ ] **Pin trek-rs dependency and target**
  - Pin to `trek-rs = "=0.2.1"` (confirmed available on crates.io)
  - Pin to `wasm32-wasip2` Component Model (Tier-2 support via rustup)
  - Remove any `wasm32-wasip1` references

- [ ] **Implement Component Model (no WASI I/O)**
  - Add `wit/extractor.wit` with typed `extract(html, url, mode) -> string` function
  - Implement guest with `wit-bindgen` (no `_start` entrypoint)
  - Host: use `wasmtime::component::bindgen!` and call typed `extract()` function
  - Remove stdin/stdout piping and WASI command interface

- [ ] **WASM-Core integration**
  - Replace extract.rs WASI command code with Component Model calls
  - Handle WASM errors and fallbacks gracefully
  - Load component once per worker for performance

### 1.2 API Implementation - HIGH PRIORITY
**Issues**: Missing handler implementations, no health endpoints

- [ ] **Complete API handlers**
  - Implement `/healthz` endpoint (referenced but missing)
  - Complete `/crawl` batch processing logic
  - Implement `/deepsearch` with Serper.dev integration
  - Add proper error handling and status codes

- [ ] **Core business logic**
  - Implement gate.rs decision algorithm (currently placeholder)
  - Connect fetch → gate → extract → render pipeline
  - Add caching layer with Redis integration
  - Wire all components together

### 1.3 Essential Testing - HIGH PRIORITY
**Issues**: No working test suite, validation failures

- [ ] **Golden test suite**
  - Use offline fixtures in CI to avoid flaky tests
  - Create expected output JSONs for 4+ fixture files
  - Implement golden test runner for regression detection
  - Reserve real URL tests for manual/staging runs

- [ ] **Integration tests**
  - Create working e2e test suite in `tests/e2e/`
  - Test full pipeline with offline fixtures
  - Add Docker compose test environment
  - CI builds WASM component (`wasip2`) and runs `cargo test -- --include-ignored`
