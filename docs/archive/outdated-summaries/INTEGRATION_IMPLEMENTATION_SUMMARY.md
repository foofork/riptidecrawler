## 2. Circuit Breaker Integration (NEWLY IMPLEMENTED)

### Status: ✅ COMPLETED

Successfully integrated circuit breaker for fault tolerance and resilience.

### Implementation Details:

#### A. AppState Structure Updates
**File**: `/workspaces/eventmesh/crates/riptide-api/src/state.rs`

Added fields to AppState (lines 77-81):
```rust
/// Circuit breaker for resilience and fault tolerance
pub circuit_breaker: Arc<tokio::sync::Mutex<CircuitBreakerState>>,

/// Performance metrics for circuit breaker tracking
pub performance_metrics: Arc<tokio::sync::Mutex<PerformanceMetrics>>,
```

#### B. Configuration Structure
**File**: `/workspaces/eventmesh/crates/riptide-api/src/state.rs` (lines 118-150)

Created CircuitBreakerConfig with environment variable support:
```rust
pub struct CircuitBreakerConfig {
    pub failure_threshold: u8,      // Default: 50%
    pub timeout_ms: u64,            // Default: 5000ms
    pub min_requests: u64,          // Default: 10
}
```

**Environment Variables**:
- `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD` - Failure rate % to trip breaker (default: 50)
- `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TIMEOUT_MS` - Timeout before testing recovery (default: 5000)
- `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_MIN_REQUESTS` - Min requests before evaluation (default: 10)

#### C. Circuit Breaker Initialization
**File**: `/workspaces/eventmesh/crates/riptide-api/src/state.rs` (lines 522-532)

```rust
// Initialize circuit breaker for fault tolerance
let circuit_breaker = Arc::new(tokio::sync::Mutex::new(CircuitBreakerState::default()));

// Initialize performance metrics for circuit breaker tracking
let performance_metrics = Arc::new(tokio::sync::Mutex::new(PerformanceMetrics::default()));
```

#### D. Health Check Integration
**File**: `/workspaces/eventmesh/crates/riptide-api/src/state.rs` (lines 660-671)

Added circuit breaker health checking:
```rust
health.circuit_breaker = {
    let cb_state = self.circuit_breaker.lock().await;
    if cb_state.is_open() {
        health.healthy = false;
        DependencyHealth::Unhealthy("Circuit breaker is open - too many failures")
    } else if cb_state.is_half_open() {
        DependencyHealth::Unhealthy("Circuit breaker is testing recovery")
    } else {
        DependencyHealth::Healthy
    }
};
```

### Circuit Breaker States:

1. **Closed** (Normal Operation)
   - Requests flow normally
   - Tracking failure/success counts
   - Evaluates failure rate after min_requests

2. **Open** (Failure Protection)
   - Rejecting requests immediately
   - Preventing cascading failures
   - Waits for timeout_ms before testing

3. **HalfOpen** (Recovery Testing)
   - Allowing limited test requests
   - Testing if service recovered
   - Transitions to Closed on success or Open on failure

---

## 3. Event Emissions in Handlers (NEWLY IMPLEMENTED)

### Status: ✅ COMPLETED

Added comprehensive event emissions to track request lifecycle.

### A. Crawl Handler Events
**File**: `/workspaces/eventmesh/crates/riptide-api/src/handlers/crawl.rs`

#### Events Emitted:

1. **crawl.started** (lines 40-48)
   - Triggered when crawl request received
   - Metadata: url_count, cache_mode, concurrency

2. **crawl.completed** (lines 167-176)
   - Triggered when crawl request finishes
   - Metadata: total_urls, successful, failed, cache_hits, duration_ms, cache_hit_rate

### B. Deepsearch Handler Events
**File**: `/workspaces/eventmesh/crates/riptide-api/src/handlers/deepsearch.rs`

#### Events Emitted:

1. **deepsearch.started** (lines 34-40)
   - Triggered when deepsearch request received
   - Metadata: query, limit, include_content

2. **deepsearch.completed** (lines 140-147)
   - Triggered when deepsearch finishes
   - Metadata: query, urls_found, urls_crawled, duration_ms

## Configuration Guide

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Circuit Breaker Configuration
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD=50    # % failure rate to trip breaker
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TIMEOUT_MS=5000         # Time before testing recovery
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_MIN_REQUESTS=10         # Min requests before evaluation

# Event Bus Configuration (already configured)
# Uses defaults from EventBusConfig
```

### Recommended Production Settings:

```bash
# Stricter circuit breaker for production
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD=30    # Trip at 30% failure rate
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TIMEOUT_MS=10000        # Wait 10s before testing recovery
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_MIN_REQUESTS=20         # Evaluate after 20 requests
```

---

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Circuit Breaker Testing
```bash
# Test circuit breaker with simulated failures
# Send requests to failing endpoint
# Verify circuit opens after threshold
# Wait for timeout and verify half-open state
# Send successful request and verify circuit closes
```

### 2. Event Emission Testing
```bash
# Monitor event bus during requests
# Verify crawl.started events emitted
# Verify crawl.completed events with correct metadata
# Check deepsearch event emissions
# Confirm event handlers process events correctly
```

### 3. Health Check Testing
```bash
# Call /healthz endpoint
# Verify circuit_breaker health status
# Test with open circuit breaker
# Verify health endpoint reports unhealthy
```
