3. **Superseded Documentation**: Newer, more comprehensive documents replace older ones
4. **Obsolete Information**: Technical details that no longer apply to current system

## Accessing Archived Content

If you need information from archived documents:
1. Check the current documentation first - most content has been consolidated
2. Refer to [COMPLETED.md](../COMPLETED.md) for historical project milestones
3. Use [DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md](../DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md) to find the current location of information
