**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-10
**Status:** Actionable Roadmap
**Target Release:** v1.0 Production-Ready

---

## Executive Summary

### Current State Assessment

The EventMesh/RipTide codebase is **85% production-ready** with a solid foundation but requires strategic cleanup before v1.0 release. Analysis of the codebase reveals:

**Codebase Metrics:**
- **Total Files:** 14,454+ TypeScript/JavaScript/Rust files
- **Code Suppressions:** 500+ items across 6 categories
- **Test Coverage:** ~80-85% (269 active test modules)
- **Documentation:** 33 analysis documents, comprehensive API docs
- **Active Features:** Core extraction, PDF processing, performance profiling
- **Pending Features:** Streaming, sessions, advanced provider support

**Health Indicators:**
- ✅ **Core Functionality:** Complete and tested (HTML/PDF extraction, LLM integration)
- ✅ **Architecture:** Well-designed with proper separation of concerns
- ✅ **Testing:** Comprehensive unit and integration test infrastructure
- ✅ **Documentation:** Extensive analysis and activation guides
- ⚠️ **Code Cleanup:** 240+ dead code suppressions need resolution
- ⚠️ **Feature Completeness:** 67 P1 items need activation or removal
- ⚠️ **Test Suite:** 15 ignored tests blocking CI/CD confidence

**Critical Findings:**

1. **Production-Ready Components (Keep & Polish):**
   - Core HTML extraction with wasm-rs
   - PDF processing (pdfium-render)
   - Local LLM providers (Ollama, LocalAI)
   - Performance profiling (memory, cache, resource limits)
   - WASM extractor (core features complete)

2. **Need Activation Decision (P1 Priority):**
   - Session persistence (requires Redis)
   - Event bus integration (ready, needs wiring)
   - Cloud LLM providers (Anthropic, Vertex AI - implementation complete)
   - Metrics/observability (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry)
   - Table extraction feature

3. **Defer to v2+ (P2 Priority):**
   - Streaming infrastructure (complete but needs integration tests)
   - Advanced spider features (query-aware, adaptive stopping)
   - WASM enhancements (link/media extraction, language detection)
   - AWS Bedrock provider (mock implementation only)

4. **Remove/Archive (Technical Debt):**
   - Commented-out code (20+ instances)
   - Unused imports (7 instances)
   - Deprecated examples and documentation
   - Mock implementations (if not activating)

### Strategic Recommendation

**For v1.0 Release:** Focus on **stability, core features, and production-readiness** rather than feature completeness.

**Core Principle:** Ship a **reliable, well-documented, production-grade** extraction platform with extensibility for future enhancements.
