## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Instance Pool System → `riptide-pool` ⭐ HIGHEST PRIORITY
**Lines to Extract**: ~2,500
**Impact**: Very High
**Ease**: Medium
**Risk**: Low (well-isolated)

#### Files to Extract
```
instance_pool/
├── pool.rs           (1,005 lines) - Main pool implementation
├── health.rs         (200 lines)   - Health monitoring
├── memory.rs         (150 lines)   - Memory management
├── models.rs         (100 lines)   - Pool data structures
├── mod.rs            (50 lines)    - Module definitions
memory_manager.rs     (1,107 lines) - Memory orchestration
pool_health.rs        (792 lines)   - Pool health checks
cache_warming.rs      (881 lines)   - Pool warming strategies
```

**Total**: ~4,285 lines available, extract **~2,500 core pool lines**

#### Dependencies
```rust
// External
use tokio, async-trait, sysinfo, psutil, tracing

// Internal (to be extracted with pool)
use crate::events       // Move to riptide-events first
use crate::monitoring   // Already extracted to riptide-monitoring ✓
use crate::security     // Already extracted to riptide-security ✓
```

#### Public API Design
```rust
// riptide-pool/src/lib.rs
pub mod pool;
pub mod health;
pub mod memory;
pub mod warming;
pub mod models;

pub use pool::{AdvancedInstancePool, create_event_aware_pool};
pub use health::{PoolHealthMonitor, HealthCheckConfig};
pub use memory::{MemoryManager, MemoryStats};
pub use warming::{CacheWarmer, WarmingStrategy};
pub use models::{PooledInstance, CircuitBreakerState, PoolMetrics};
```

#### Benefits
- ✅ Removes largest subsystem from core (~14% of total)
- ✅ Well-defined boundaries
- ✅ Minimal coupling to core logic
- ✅ Can be versioned independently
- ✅ Easier to test in isolation

#### Migration Path
1. Create `riptide-pool` crate structure
2. Move pool-related files
3. Extract memory_manager.rs logic
4. Update imports in core to use `riptide_pool::`
5. Update Cargo.toml dependencies
6. Run integration tests

- ⚠️  integrated_cache.rs temporarily disabled (circular dependency with riptide-core)
- ✅ Added backward compatibility re-exports in riptide-core
- ✅ All tests passing (13 tests in riptide-cache)

#### Files Extracted
```

### 6. AI Processor → Extend `riptide-intelligence` 🤖 LOW PRIORITY
**Lines to Extract**: ~500
**Impact**: Low
**Ease**: Low (AI integration complexity)
**Risk**: High

#### File to Move
```
ai_processor.rs (482 lines) - AI enhancement processor
```

#### Current State

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Extractions ✅
- **Events System**: Clean interfaces, no circular deps
- **Cache System**: Well-isolated, existing crate structure
- **Strategy Composition**: Pure orchestration logic

### Medium Risk Extractions ⚠️
- **Instance Pool**: Large subsystem, many internal deps
- **Reliability Layer**: Used throughout core

### High Risk Extractions 🚨
- **AI Processor**: Tight coupling to extraction pipeline
- **Core Type System**: Foundational, risky to move

---

## Success Metrics

### Phase 2 Goals
- ✅ Reduce core from 17.5K → 10.9K lines (38% reduction)
- ✅ Create 2 new crates (riptide-events, riptide-pool)
- ✅ Enhance 1 existing crate (riptide-cache)
- ✅ Maintain 100% test coverage
- ✅ Zero breaking changes to public API
- ✅ All benchmarks pass

### Quality Gates
- All existing tests must pass
- No performance regressions >5%
- Documentation updated for all new crates
- CI/CD pipeline green
- Zero circular dependencies

---

## Conclusion

**Recommended Action**: Execute Phase 2A-2C to achieve **10.9K lines** (38% reduction).

This brings riptide-core to a sustainable size while maintaining clean architecture and avoiding circular dependencies. The extractions are well-isolated and can be executed safely over 3 weeks.

**Key Success Factors**:
1. Extract events first (unlocks pool)
2. Extract pool second (largest reduction)
3. Enhance cache third (consolidation)
4. Keep strategy/reliability for Phase 3
5. Maintain rigorous testing throughout

**Next Steps**:
1. Get approval for Phase 2 plan
2. Create extraction tracking issues
3. Set up new crate scaffolding
4. Begin Phase 2A (events extraction)
