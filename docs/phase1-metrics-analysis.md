- **Impact:** Blocks WASM extraction, strategies, spider integration
- **Fix Complexity:** Medium (2-4 hours)
- **Dependencies:** None

**2. riptide-pdf Type Mismatches (2 errors)**
- **Root Cause:** `markdown` field type changed to `Option<String>`

## Conclusion

Phase 1 has achieved substantial architectural improvements with 85% completion, but is currently blocked by 15 compilation errors in 2 crates. The modularization effort successfully extracted 4 major crates and eliminated technical debt. With an estimated 2.5-4.5 hours of focused error resolution, Phase 1 can reach full completion with zero errors and zero warnings.

**Next Steps:** Execute immediate fixes for riptide-extraction and riptide-pdf, then run comprehensive validation to achieve Phase 1 completion.
