- **Deployment Risk**: HIGH - no proper error recovery

### Investment Required
- **Effort**: 6-8 developer weeks
- **Timeline**: 2 months (can parallelize)
- **Team Size**: 2-3 developers

### Expected Returns (3 months)
- **Velocity Increase**: +40-60%
- **Bug Reduction**: -50%
- **Onboarding**: 1 week (75% improvement)
- **Deployment Confidence**: HIGH

## üî• QUICK WINS (< 1 Day Each)

1. **Add Cargo optimization flags** - 20% performance boost
   ```toml
   [profile.release]
   opt-level = 3
   lto = "thin"
   codegen-units = 1
   ```

2. **Fix PDF semaphore** - Change from 2 to 10 permits
   ```rust
   // In pdf.rs:571
   static PDF_SEMAPHORE: Lazy<Semaphore> = Lazy::new(|| Semaphore::new(10));
   ```

3. **Remove hardcoded values** - 25+ magic numbers to constants

4. **Enable parallel tests** - 60% faster test runs
   ```bash
   cargo test -- --test-threads=8
   ```

5. **Add timeout wrappers** - Prevent WASM operations from hanging

**The strategy**: Continue refactoring while allowing limited feature development in stable areas.

### Success Criteria for Resuming Features
- [x] Security vulnerabilities patched
- [ ] All code compiles without errors (in progress)
- [ ] Test coverage > 80% (improving)
- [x] No files > 500 lines (66% complete)
