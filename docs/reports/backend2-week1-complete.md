# Backend Developer #2 - Week 1 Completion Report

**Agent:** Backend Developer #2
**Period:** Phase 1 & 2 - Week 1
**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Tasks Completed

### QW-4: Remove Remaining Dead Code ✅

#### API Client Cleanup (`crates/riptide-cli/src/api_client.rs`)
**Removed Dead Code:**
- ❌ `ScreenshotRequest` struct (68 lines)
- ❌ `ExtractRequest` struct (79 lines)
- ❌ `ExtractionResult` struct (91 lines)
- ❌ `ExtractionMetadata` struct (102 lines)
- ❌ `screenshot()` method (180-215 lines)
- ❌ `extract()` method (217-251 lines)

**Lines Removed:** ~140 lines of dead code
**Documentation Added:** Clear comments explaining removal rationale

**Rationale:**
- Screenshot functionality now handled by `render()` method with `screenshot_mode`
- Extraction functionality moved to dedicated `riptide-extraction` module
- No usages found in codebase

#### Session Management Cleanup (`crates/riptide-cli/src/session/`)

**Files Modified:**
- `session/manager.rs` - Removed `sessions_dir()` function
- `session/types.rs` - Removed 3 unused methods

**Removed Methods:**
- ❌ `Session::is_expired()` - Session timeout not enforced
- ❌ `Session::to_cookie_jar()` - Direct field access used instead
- ❌ `Session::from_cookie_jar()` - `Session::new()` handles creation
- ❌ `SessionManager::sessions_dir()` - Not called anywhere

**Lines Removed:** ~50 lines of dead code
**Functions Preserved:** `get_session_by_name()`, `use_session()`, `mark_used()` (actively used)

**Validation Notes:**
- Verified functions actually called via grep analysis
- Kept `mark_used()` - called from `session/mod.rs:25`
- Removed session timeout methods - feature not implemented
- All removals have clear documentation comments

### QW-5: Document Architecture (ADRs) ✅

**Key Points:**
- Performance improvement targets
- Migration strategy with fallback support
- Integration with stealth system
- Consequences and mitigation strategies

- Performance comparison matrix
- Hybrid mode with auto-selection
- Use case mapping

**Strategies:**
- CSS Selector (fast, precise)
