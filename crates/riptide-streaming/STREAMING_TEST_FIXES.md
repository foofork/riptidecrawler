# Riptide-Streaming Test Compilation Fixes

## Summary
All test files in riptide-streaming have been fixed to compile successfully.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/crates/riptide-streaming/Cargo.toml`
**Changes:**
- Added missing dev-dependencies:
  - `httpmock = "0.7"` - For HTTP mocking in tests
  - `fastrand = "2.0"` - For random data generation
  - `tracing-test = "0.2"` - For tracing in tests

**Why:** Test files require these dependencies but they were not declared.

### 2. `/crates/riptide-streaming/tests/streaming_tests.rs`
**Changes:**
- Removed invalid imports: `use crate::fixtures::*` and `use crate::fixtures::test_data::*`
- Added missing import: `use std::collections::HashMap;`

**Why:** The `HashMap` type was used but not imported. The fixtures modules don't exist.

### 3. `/crates/riptide-performance/Cargo.toml`
**Changes:**
- Changed `jemalloc-ctl` to `tikv-jemalloc-ctl` in dependencies
- Updated feature flags to use `tikv-jemalloc-ctl`

**Why:** Conflict with `tikv-jemallocator` used in riptide-api - both link to the same native library.

### 4. `/crates/riptide-performance/src/profiling/memory_tracker.rs`
**Changes:**
- Changed `use jemalloc_ctl::{epoch, stats};` to `use tikv_jemalloc_ctl::{epoch, stats};`

**Why:** Updated to match the new dependency name.

### 5. `/crates/riptide-streaming/tests/test_streaming.rs`
**Changes:**
- Removed unused `ttfb_measured` variable and simplified TTFB checking
- Fixed `first_result_time` usage by removing Option<> wrapper and calculating directly
- Simplified streaming tests to avoid unused variable warnings

**Why:** Compiler errors for unused variables and incorrect type usage.

### 6. `/crates/riptide-streaming/tests/streaming_validation_tests.rs`
**Changes:**
- Fixed `?` operator usage in timeout context:
  ```rust
  // Before:
  .await
  .map_err(|_| StreamingError::Timeout)?
  .expect("High load test should succeed");

  // After:
  .await
  .map_err(|_| StreamingError::Timeout)
  .and_then(|r| r)
  .expect("High load test should succeed");
  ```

**Why:** The `?` operator doesn't work in this context; need to use `.and_then()` instead.

### 7. `/crates/riptide-streaming/tests/ndjson_stream_tests.rs`
**Changes:**
- Added `#[allow(unused_variables)]` annotation for variables used in closures

**Why:** Some variables appear unused but are needed for test setup.

## Test Files Status

| File | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `streaming_tests.rs` | ✅ Fixed | Removed invalid imports, added HashMap |
| `ndjson_stream_tests.rs` | ✅ Fixed | Added allow annotations |
| `test_streaming.rs` | ✅ Fixed | Simplified variable usage |
| `streaming_validation_tests.rs` | ✅ Fixed | Fixed ? operator usage |
| `streaming_integration_tests.rs` | ✅ OK | No changes needed |
| `deepsearch_stream_tests.rs` | ✅ OK | No changes needed |

## Key Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: Missing Dependencies
**Problem:** Test files used `httpmock`, `fastrand`, and `tracing-test` but they weren't in Cargo.toml.
**Solution:** Added all three as dev-dependencies.

### Issue 2: HashMap Import
**Problem:** `streaming_tests.rs` used `HashMap` without importing it.
**Solution:** Added `use std::collections::HashMap;`

### Issue 3: Jemalloc Conflict
**Problem:** Both `jemalloc-ctl` and `tikv-jemallocator` link to the same native `jemalloc` library, causing a conflict.
**Solution:** Use `tikv-jemalloc-ctl` everywhere for consistency.

### Issue 4: Unused Variables
**Problem:** Variables like `ttfb_measured` and `first_result_time` were declared but not used properly.
**Solution:** Simplified the logic to avoid declaring variables that aren't used.

### Issue 5: Error Handling in Async
**Problem:** Using `?` operator after `.map_err()` in `timeout()` context doesn't work.
**Solution:** Use `.and_then(|r| r)` to properly propagate the inner Result.

## Testing

To verify all tests compile:
```bash
cargo test -p riptide-streaming --no-run
```

To run specific test files:
```bash
cargo test -p riptide-streaming --test streaming_tests --no-run
cargo test -p riptide-streaming --test ndjson_stream_tests --no-run
cargo test -p riptide-streaming --test test_streaming --no-run
cargo test -p riptide-streaming --test streaming_validation_tests --no-run
cargo test -p riptide-streaming --test streaming_integration_tests --no-run
cargo test -p riptide-streaming --test deepsearch_stream_tests --no-run
```

## Notes

1. **Compilation Time:** The full workspace compilation can be slow due to the number of dependencies. Use `cargo check` for faster feedback during development.

2. **Mock Servers:** Tests using `MockServer` require the `httpmock` dependency which is now properly declared.

3. **Jemalloc:** The jemalloc allocator is now consistently using the `tikv-` prefixed versions to avoid conflicts.

4. **Integration Tests:** The streaming integration tests work with the actual library code and test the complete streaming workflow.

## Remaining Work

None - all compilation errors in riptide-streaming test files have been resolved.

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check compilation of the streaming crate and its tests
cargo check -p riptide-streaming --tests

# Compile all test binaries without running them
cargo test -p riptide-streaming --no-run

# Run a specific test to verify it works
cargo test -p riptide-streaming --test streaming_integration_tests -- test_complete_streaming_workflow
```
