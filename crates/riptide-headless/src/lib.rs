//! RipTide Headless Browser Management Library
//!
//! This library provides browser pool management for headless browser operations.
//! It includes connection pooling, health checking, and automatic recovery.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! **NOTE**: Core browser engine components have been extracted to `riptide-engine` crate.
//! This crate now serves as a compatibility layer and HTTP API wrapper.
//!
//! - **HeadlessLauncher**: High-level API for launching browser sessions (from riptide-engine)
//! - **BrowserPool**: Low-level browser instance pool (from riptide-engine)
//! - **LaunchSession**: Managed browser session with automatic cleanup (from riptide-engine)
//! - **CDP API**: HTTP endpoints for browser automation
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use riptide_headless::HeadlessLauncher;
//! # async fn example() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
//! // Create launcher with pooling
//! let launcher = HeadlessLauncher::new().await?;
//!
//! // Launch a page with stealth
//! let session = launcher.launch_page_default("https://example.com").await?;
//!
//! // Access the page
//! let page = session.page();
//! let content = page.content().await?;
//!
//! // Session automatically returns browser to pool when dropped
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
