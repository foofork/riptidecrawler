# RipTide CLI Real-World Testing - Final Report

## Date: October 16, 2025

## Executive Summary

Successfully created comprehensive real-world testing infrastructure for the RipTide CLI with 26 test URLs across 6 categories. The test framework is ready for execution once the binary compilation issues are resolved.

## Completed Work

### 1. Test Infrastructure ✅
- Created 6 test suite YAML files covering diverse content types
- Built comprehensive test runner script (`run_extraction_tests.sh`)
- Implemented CSV output generation for validation metrics
- Added URL verification tooling

### 2. Test Coverage

| Suite | URLs | Accessible | Category |
|-------|------|------------|----------|
| 00_static_docs | 5 | 5 (100%) | Documentation sites |
| 10_news_articles | 5 | 4 (80%) | News websites |
| 20_product_pages | 4 | 2 (50%) | E-commerce |
| 30_listings | 4 | 4 (100%) | Aggregator sites |
| 40_tables_pdfs | 4 | 3 (75%) | PDF documents |
| 50_events_hilversum | 4 | 4 (100%) | Event listings |
| **TOTAL** | **26** | **22 (84.6%)** | **All categories** |

### 3. CSV Output Structure

#### extraction_results.csv
```csv
Suite,Test_Name,URL,Type,Success,Content_Length,Title_Present,Text_Extracted,Time_ms,Error_Message
```

#### summary.csv
```csv
Metric,Value
Total_Tests,26
Successful,X
Failed,Y
Success_Rate,Z%
```

#### suite_performance.csv
```csv
Suite,Total,Success,Failed,Avg_Content_Length,Avg_Time_ms,Success_Rate
```

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Metrics System Enhancement
- Added graceful handling of corrupted metrics files
- Implemented automatic recovery on deserialization failures
- Added warning messages for better debugging

### 2. Extraction Configuration
- Configured `--local` flag for WASM execution without API server
- Updated test scripts to use correct CLI syntax
- Mapped content types to appropriate extraction strategies

## Performance Targets (from Specification)

| Content Type | Target | Status |
|--------------|--------|--------|
| Static docs | >90% | Ready to test |
| News sites | >85% | Ready to test |
| E-commerce | >70% | Ready to test |
| **Overall** | **>85%** | **Infrastructure ready** |

## Known Issues

### 1. Binary Execution
- **Issue**: Metrics initialization error on first run
- **Status**: Fixed in code, needs recompilation
- **Workaround**: Added error recovery in `storage.rs`

### 2. Blocked URLs (4 total)
- Reuters Special Report (401 Forbidden)
- B&H Photo products (403 Forbidden, 2 URLs)
- OECD PDF (403 Forbidden)

```

## Test Execution Commands

### Run all tests:
```bash
./eval/run_extraction_tests.sh
```

### Test single URL:
```bash
./eval/test_single_url.sh "https://example.com" raw auto
```

### Direct binary test:
```bash
./target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/riptide extract \
    --url "https://example.com" \
    --engine raw \
    --local \
    --no-wasm
```

## Next Steps

1. **Rebuild Binary**: Complete compilation with metrics fix
2. **Execute Tests**: Run full test suite on 22 accessible URLs
3. **Analyze Results**: Compare extraction success rates against targets
4. **Performance Metrics**: Measure P95 latency (target <500ms static, <1s news, <3s complex)
5. **Memory Usage**: Validate <100MB average memory consumption

## Conclusion

The real-world testing infrastructure is **fully implemented** and ready for execution. All test suites, scripts, and validation frameworks are in place. The CSV output structure will provide comprehensive metrics for validating against the specification requirements.

### Key Achievements:
- ✅ 26 real-world URLs across 6 categories
- ✅ Comprehensive test runner with CSV output
- ✅ URL verification showing 84.6% availability
- ✅ Metrics error handling improved
- ✅ Test commands documented and ready

### Remaining:
- ⏳ Binary compilation with fixes
- ⏳ Actual extraction execution
- ⏳ Performance validation
